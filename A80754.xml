            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For when God made promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf, ſaying, ſurely, bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And ſo after he had patiently endured, he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promiſe. For men verily ſwear by the greater, and an Oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.

                  <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſuch at leaſt as did profeſs the faith of Chriſt, as appeareth in that he calleth them <hi>holy Brethren, partakers of the Heavenly calling,</hi> of whoſe profeſſion <hi>Chriſt was the Apoſtle and High Prieſt,</hi> chap. 3. 1. They had been inſtructed <hi>in the Doctrin of Chriſt,</hi> chap. 5. &amp; 6. He commends them for their <hi>labour of love, in miniſtring to the Saints,</hi> chap. 6.

               <p>Now theſe believers were many of them forſakeing the Ordinances, of the Worſhip, of the New Teſtament; they were caſting off their holy profeſſion, whereof Chriſt Jeſus was the Apoſtle and High Prieſt, and were going back again to <hi>Moſes;</hi> as we ſee alſo in other Epiſtles to the Churches, eſpecially in that to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> This Apoſtaſy he endeavoureth in this Epiſtle to prevent and cure. And that is his main ſcope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as appeareth, becauſe ſtill in the cloſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations, which are many, his concluſions are by way of exhortation to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, <hi>to hold faſt their profeſſion, and their liberty;</hi> ch. 4. 14. having ſaid ſomething before by way of Argument, thus he concludeth, <hi>Having therefore ſuch an High Prieſt, Jeſus the Son of God, who is entred into the Heavens, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> And verſe 16. <hi>let us come with boldneſs,</hi>

               <p>Again chap. 7. 8. 9. See how he argues all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, not to prove that Chriſt was come,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118924:6"/> but (taking that for granted) to prove that upon his comming there was to be a change of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and of the <hi>Law</hi> of the worſhip of God.

               <p>The bondage of the <hi>Jews</hi> did chiefly ſtand in this, that they were under ſuch Ordinances and Adminiſtrations of worſhip. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9.

               <p>Again chap. 12. 15. 16. his exhortation is, that they would not <hi>ſell their birthright;</hi> what is the birthright of believers (for of ſuch he ſpeaketh) which they can ſell? is it not their priviledges in the Church, and Worſhip of the Goſpel? Of which alſo is meant that oppoſition between the Old Teſtament and the New, in the following part of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>I ſhall name but one place more, that is, chap. 4. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore the keeping of a Sabbath for the people of God.</hi> His arguments from whence he thus concludes, we have before from <hi>Pſ.</hi> 95. begining chap. 3. v. 7. where the Saints of the New Teſtament
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118924:7"/> (as appeareth by the Apoſtles application of that Scripture) are prophetically brought in thus exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, <hi>O come let us worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our maker, for he is our God, and we are the people of his paſture and ſheep of his hand; to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> I <hi>am the good Shepherd</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, Joh. 10.) <hi>and my ſheep will hear my voice:</hi> therefore that is made the argument among the Saints exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another to <hi>come, and worſhip, and kneel before the Lord,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>voice</hi> of Chriſt the great Shepherd of our ſoules that calls us to it; and that we <hi>harden not our hearts,</hi> as they did in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> to whom he was a Shepherd alſo, called the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 80. 1. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 20.</p>
               <p>And becauſe two things eſpecially he doth for us as our Shepherd, namely, he feeds us, and gives us reſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt, and where thou cauſeſt thy flock to reſt at noon:</hi> therefore that is made the Argument further, leſt he <hi>ſwear againſt us in his wrath,</hi> as he did againſt them, that we ſhall not <hi>enter into his reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle from that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. in order to perſwade them to the worſhip of the Goſpel, in theſe two Chapters, the third and fourth, proveth the Chriſtian Sabbath, as we ſhall ſee anon. Such is the connection between theſe two, the Worſhip, and the Sabbath, as he that grants the one muſt not deny the other; therefore having brought his Arguments for that his purpoſe he thus concludeth, v. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore the keeping of a Sabbath</hi> (ſo in the margent, and in the Greek) for the people of God. He ſaith not there remaineth a Sabbath, but a <hi>Sabbatiſme,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118924:7"/> of God. Becauſe theſe believers to whom he wrot were forſaking not onely the Chriſtian Sabbath, but alſo the Worſhip: &amp; ſo his ſcope there being to prove both, and to prove the one by the other, therefore he uſeth this word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, rightly rendred the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sabbath,</hi> which comprehendeth both the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it ſelf, and the Celebration of it in the houſe of Gods reſt, in the ſolemn inſtituted Worſhip. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore the celebration of a Sabbath for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> Now, I ſay, ſuch being his concluſions, by this we ſee, that a main ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle is, to prevent this their Apoſtacy from the Worſhip of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Having thus found out his ſcope, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo and very uſeful ſundry ways, in that which I intend to inſiſt upon from theſe words, that wee conſider alſo, in the ſecond place, what courſe he takes to prevail with them in this matter; namely, Firſt, whereas the Ordinances of the Old Teſtament were given by Angels, and by the hand of <hi>Moſes, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53. And the Ordinances of the New Teſtament by Chriſt himſelfe. In the two firſt Chapters he ſets out the dignity of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Angels. And in the third Chapter he prefers him before <hi>Moſes. Conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithfull to him that appointed him, as</hi> Moſes <hi>alſo was faithful in all his houſe.</hi> He to be eſteemed as the builder, and ſuch a builder as <hi>made the World,</hi> and <hi>is God.</hi> Verſe 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> but as a <hi>Stone</hi> in that building; he as the <hi>Son,</hi> and as an <hi>Owner; Moſes</hi> onely as a <hi>Servant</hi> in this houſe. Now having thus prepared them, he faleth upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſubject: &amp; having made mention of the houſe of Chriſt, He layeth down that propoſition, chap. 3. 6.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118924:8"/> 
                  <hi>His houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and the rejoycing of the hope firm to the end.</hi> That is, if we forſake not the Worſhip of the Goſpel. Becauſe under the Jewiſh Ordinances they were in a ſtate of bondage, and becauſe that <hi>Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which we draw nigh to God, Heb.</hi> 7. 19. therefore their holding faſt the Ordinances and Priviledges of the Goſpel he calleth an <hi>holding faſt the confidence or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the rejoycing of the hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the houſe of God is the place of his reſt, (as we ſee <hi>Eſai.</hi> 66. 1. <hi>Where is the houſe that ye will build for me? or where is the place of my reſt?</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 8. 14.) He taketh occaſion thence to exhort them, not to refuſe the offer made by Chriſt unto them of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in his houſe: and that he doth,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the words of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 95. where he findes an exhortation for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, penned to his hand. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) that is, becauſe wee are his houſe, (<hi>as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith) to day if ye will hear his voice</hi> (that is, the voice of Chriſt, for his voice it is, whoſe houſe and ſheep we are:) <hi>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſs, when your Fathers tempted me, proved me, and ſaw my works forty years; wherefore I had in diſdain that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (and ſaid, they do alway erre in their hearts, and they have not known my ways) as I ſware,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>in my wrath, that they ſhall not enter into my reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet preſſeth us to hear his voice in this matter, becauſe he is our Shepherd, and we <hi>the people of his paſture, and the ſheep of his hand,</hi> as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Apoſtle urgeth us to hear his voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the <hi>Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118924:8"/> faithful in his houſe as the Son, and the Builder of it. He varieth the title, but he ſpeaks to the ſame thing: for what the Lord Chriſt doth as the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion in his houſe, he doth it as the great Shepherd of our ſoules: as we ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. where <hi>David</hi> ſeting forth the bleſſings of his houſe (as we ſee in the cloſe of the Pſalm, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever</hi>) he doth it by this; <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd, I ſhal not want. He maketh me to lie down in green paſtures, he leadeth me by the ſtil waters, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We heard before that two things eſpecially he doth for us as our Shepherd; he feeds us, and he gives us reſt. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>He giveth us green paſtures,</hi> &amp; he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to <hi>lie down</hi> therein. <hi>He ſpreds a Table for us,</hi> and that <hi>in the preſence of our Enemies.</hi> Both theſe he giveth us in himſelf; he is our Bread of Life, &amp; he is our Reſt. In order to both theſe, he hath built us an Houſe of reſt, which is his Church, as we ſhall ſee anon: <hi>There he feeds us,</hi> and there he <hi>cauſeth his flock to reſt at noon. Cant.</hi> 1. 7. He appoints alſo a day of reſt to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his houſe, in the Service of it.</p>
               <p>And becauſe his ſheep are not as the wild beaſts, that live of their own finding, but are under the government and guidance of their Shepherd; therfore called the <hi>Sheep of his hand, Pſal.</hi> 95. that is, of his government, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 20. and ſuch as <hi>know his voice;</hi> therefore at his voice it is, that they come together as his flock in his houſe and Worſhip, and that upon the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it by himſelfe. <hi>O come let us Worſhip and bow down &amp;c. To day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c.</hi> All this he doth as our Shepherd, and he doth it alſo as the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, in as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118924:9"/> much as in that capacity he appoints his houſe, and the ſervice of it, and was faithful therein to him that appointed him, as the Apoſtle ſheweth.</p>
               <p>And in as much as he is <hi>Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> as he is of his houſe, and hath ſet apart and ſanctified that day, for the ſervice of it; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much in effect, as if every Sabbath day we heard from him a voice inviting us to reſt with him in his houſe; therefore is it that the Prophet brings in the people of God in that manner, <hi>as upon that day,</hi> exhorting one another, ſaying, <hi>O come let us Worſhip, &amp;c. to day if ye will hear his voice.</hi> Nor is there any other day wherein the Saints can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ordinarily, to exhort and ſtirre up one another to worſhip God; The other ſix days are appointed for labour, <hi>Exod,</hi> 20. 9.</p>
               <p>I have been willing to ſtay the longer upon this, becauſe it will be uſeful in opening the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we ſhall ſee anon. And becauſe in theſe two chapters, the third and fourth, we have a clear evidence for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath, which alſo I ſhall make ſome uſe of in clearing the duty of Infant-Baptiſme, which is the thing eſpecially intended in this diſcourſe; for which cauſe alſo I ſhal ſtay yet a litle longer upon theſe two chapters, before I come to my Text, to ſhew from the words of the Apoſtle that by, <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. is meant the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath day; which may be cleared in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is evident that it is meant of a day of reſt, chap. 4. 7, 8. <hi>He limiteth a certain day, ſaying in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, to day, after ſo long a time, as it is ſaid, to day if ye wil hear his voice, harden not your hearts: for if Joſhuah had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118924:9"/> given them reſt,</hi> namely, that reſt of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>then would he not afterward have ſpoken of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day.</hi> Therefore of a day of reſt it muſt be meant; elſe the Apoſtles argument had not been concluding nor pertinent, becauſe many other days might have afterward been ſpoken of, although <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had given them all the reſt that was ever to be expected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is meant of ſuch a reſt as God can and ſometimes doth ſwear in his wrath againſt his own people, who are his houſe, and the people of his paſture, that they ſhall not enter into it: this cannot be ſaid of what they enjoy in their perſonal intereſt by faith only; but, as for the comfort of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Sabbath; how this may be ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that, we ſhall ſee anon, in opening the promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is meant of a Sabbath days reſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the manner of the Apoſtles arguing in this place, in as much as the Apoſtle proveth it to be another day of reſt, beſides what was in uſe in the Church before. Another in oppoſition to the ſeventh day Sabbath, and that becauſe <hi>David</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it as a reſt to be entred into <hi>a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although the ſeventh days reſt was entred into from the beginning of the world,</hi> in as much as <hi>he ſpake in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, ſaying in this wiſe, and God reſted the ſeventh day from all his works; and in this place again; if they ſhall enter into my reſt:</hi> implying a promiſe that ſome ſhall, though others ſhal not enter into it. Now, ſaies the Apoſtle, this being ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> of a time then to come: and again that <hi>he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth a certain day, ſaying in</hi> David, <hi>to day, after ſo long a time; there remaineth therefore the keeping of a Sabbath for the people of God;</hi> namely, over and beſides
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118924:10"/> the ſeventh days Sabbath. Now from this his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of arguing, it is evident that he ſuppoſeth this day of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> to be a day of the ſame kind as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath was; becauſe elſe there had been no ſuch oppoſition to be made, nor would there have been place for an <hi>although,</hi> or <hi>a notwithſtanding,</hi> in the caſe as in v. 31. becauſe any other reſt might have alſo been entred into from the beginning of the world, as a believers perſonal reſt by faith was; but that which maketh the oppoſition is that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of a <hi>Sabbath days</hi> reſt, to be entred into now a long time after, even in the times of the New Teſtament, of which times that Pſal. 95: is a Propheſie, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Apoſtles application of it in this place; and thereupon he concludes it to be another day of reſt remaining for us beſides the ſeventh days reſt. By this we ſee that by <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> is not meant only of a Chriſtians perſonal reſt by faith, which is every days enjoyment, and was entred into from the beginning of the world, but of another Sabbath days reſt beſides what was in uſe before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe it is meant of a day of reſt to be celebrated in the houſe of God, in his Worſhip. So the Apoſtle concludeth, verſe 9. <hi>There remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sabbatiſme,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the celebration of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for the people of God:</hi> a word comprehending the Sabbath and Worſhip put together, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And the coherence of the words <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth as much. <hi>O come let us worſhip and bow downe, and kneel before the Lord our maker; for we are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his paſture, and the ſheep of his hand; to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth alſo from the Apoſtles <hi>wherefore,</hi> chap. 3. 7.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118924:10"/> His houſe are we; wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c.</hi> So as if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be, what voice? or what day? the anſwer from the Pſalm, and from the Apoſtles inference, muſt be this, the day of <hi>worſhiping the Lord our maker,</hi> and of reſting with him in his <hi>houſe,</hi> and his <hi>voice,</hi> whoſe houſe we are, inviteing us unto it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe the Apoſtle underſtands it of a day to be kept upon the ſame ground, in relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt his ceaſing from his works, and entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reſt, as the ſeventh days Sabbath was in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God his ceaſing from his works, after his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the firſt creation, and entring into his. So it followeth verſe 10. <hi>There remaineth therefore the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a Sabbath to the people of God; for he that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his reſt,</hi> that is Chriſt, <hi>hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his.</hi> And that it may appear that it is Chriſt of whom he thus ſpeaketh, I muſt ſtay yet a little longer upon theſe words for the clearing of it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in theſe words maketh a further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and explication of that ninty fifth Pſalm for his purpoſe: for whereas in that Pſalm it is ſaid, that <hi>he is the Lord our maker, and we the people of his paſture, and the ſheep of his hand;</hi> and therefore ſhould <hi>come together, worſhip and bow down and kneel before him;</hi> he makes this the reaſon why this <hi>other day</hi> of reſt, of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, ſhould be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Sabbath, thus to be celebrated in his houſe and worſhip, as the former Sabbaths were, becauſe this our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>maker Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpoken of in that Pſalm, <hi>hath entred into his reſt, and ceaſed from his works as God did from his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it may appear that Chriſt is that Lord
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118924:11"/> our maker, whoſe voice we are to hear upon that day; Conſider what is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Chriſt the Apoſtle of our profeſſion, who built the houſe, and built all things, and is God,</hi> he as a <hi>Son was faithful over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the rejoycing of the hope firm to the end. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost ſaith) To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> He exhorts them, in the words of the Prophet, and brings it in with a <hi>wherefore,</hi> upon what he had ſaid of our being the houſe of Chriſt, therefore he ſuppoſeth, his voice it is we are to hear whoſe houſe we are, which (ſays the Apoſtle) is Chriſt the Son of God, who built both it and all things elſe. His houſe are we; <hi>wherefore, to day if ye will hear his voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it may alſo be clear, that thoſe words, v. 10. are to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his entring into his reſt:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I muſt a little mend the tranſlation, or rather the placing of the words therein; for theſe words, <hi>his own,</hi> in the former part of the verſe, <hi>he that hath ceaſed from his own works,</hi> (which make them ſeem to be meant of a Beleevers ceaſing from his ſin, which is his own work) are not rightly placed there, but ſhould be in the latter clauſe; thus, <hi>He alſo hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his own works;</hi> for ſo they are in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That is, as God did from the works peculiar to his firſt creation, ſo did Chriſt from his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the words, v. 14. which are brought in with a <hi>ſeeing then,</hi> pointing to ſomething going before, namely to his <hi>entring into his reſt;</hi> v. 10. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt that is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118924:11"/> into the heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> Which can refer only to thoſe words, v. 10. of his <hi>entring into his reſt,</hi> for that ſuppoſeth his <hi>paſſing into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it cannot be meant of ceaſing from ſinne, becauſe it is ſuch a ceaſing as was God's ceaſing from his works, which was ſuch as he took ſatisfaction, in what he had done; it was not onely Negative or a bare ceaſing from labour, that God entred into, but a Poſitive reſt, and ſatisfaction. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 17. <hi>He reſted the ſeventh day, and was refreſhed;</hi> And looked upon his work and ſaid, it <hi>was exceeding good.</hi> But he that ceaſeth from ſin, looketh upon that as evil, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no ſatisfaction in it at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider that thoſe words, v. 10. are the Apoſtles argument to prove that there is another reſt, or keeping of a Sabbath remaining for the people of God, beſides what they had <hi>from the beginning of the world,</hi> v. 3. <hi>and ſince</hi> Joſhuahs <hi>time,</hi> v. 8. for our cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſin upon our reſt in Chriſt by faith proveth no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I may adde, what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 5. That he is <hi>Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> He is Lord of Heaven and Earth, Lord of his Houſe, and Lord of his Worſhip. <hi>There are differences of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 5. and he is <hi>Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> which he could not be unleſſe he alſo had entred into his reſt, ceaſing from his works, as God the firſt creator did when he ceaſed from his: becauſe the reaſon of the keeping of a Sabbath is put upon this, becauſe it is the day of our <hi>Lords entring into his reſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 11.</note> Our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Sabbath in Heaven will be an entrance into <hi>the joy of our Lord;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 25. 21.</note> ſo alſo the comfort of a Sabbath
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118924:12"/> now is Communion with the Lord of the Sabbath in his own reſt. Therefore ſince he is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, he muſt enter into his reſt, as God did into his; as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of him in this place. By that which hath been ſaid, it appears, that this is meant of Chriſt his ceaſing from his works, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his reſt. Which being ſo, it is evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this other day of reſt, of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaying, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle underſtands it of a day of reſt to be kept upon the ſame ground, in reference to Chriſt his entring into his reſt, as the ſeventh day was in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his entring into his.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid from theſe two chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the Chriſtian Sabbath; but I would not ſtay too long in my paſſage to my Text. Thus much was neceſſary to be inſerted, becauſe I ſhall make uſe of it anon, where we ſhall ſee, although it may ſeem too large a digreſſion, yet that it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nor impertinent.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth, that by <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> is meant the Chriſtian Sabbath day; to the keeping whereof, in the Houſe and Worſhip of Chriſt, the Apoſtle exhorteth them (as I ſaid) Firſt, in the words of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> verſe 7. Then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, v. 12. he exhorts them in his own words to the ſame purpoſe, and as it were by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon thoſe words of <hi>David.</hi> Therefore as the Prophet, ſo the Apoſtle proceeds to preſs his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and exhortation upon them from their example who fel in the Wilderneſs, ſhewing that <hi>David</hi> in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> maketh the condition and caſe of ſuch who in the times of the Goſpel ſhall forſake the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118924:12"/> and Sabbath of the New Teſtament, refuſing to hear the voice of Chriſt inviting the <hi>people of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and ſheep of his hand,</hi> to reſt with him in his houſe upon his day, to be the ſame with theirs who <hi>tempted God in the wilderneſſe,</hi> in refuſing his offer to give them the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> deſtroying the inhabitants before them, and to give them reſt in that land; and that he will <hi>ſwear againſt them in his wrath, that they ſhall not enter into his reſt,</hi> as he had done againſt theſe who fell in the Wilderneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſhed in theſe two chapters his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and exhortations taken from that Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. he proceedeth to another, and ſtill in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the ſame work, namely, to deliver them from this forſaking of the Worſhip and Ordinances of the Goſpel, and that is this. He ſhews, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the comming of Chriſt, there was to be a change of the Prieſthood, and of the Law of Ordinances; and that Chriſt is now the onely <hi>High Priest over the houſe of God;</hi> being <hi>a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck,</hi> not after the order of <hi>Aaron.</hi> This he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the fifth chapter; he purſueth it in the ſeventh, eighth, ninth, and to the ninteenth verſe of the tenth chapter, where he concludeth, and from what he had ſaid, perſwades them againſt this Apoſtaſie.</p>
               <p>This ſixth chapter, is part of a digreſſion, which he begineth at the eleventh verſe of the fifth chapter: in which he ſharply reprehends them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs, <hi>when for the time they ought to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they had need to be again taught the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Oracles of God.</hi> But that he ſaith he would not do, but would <hi>go on to perfection,</hi> even to thoſe things which he ſaith are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: He giveth his reaſon, becauſe the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118924:13"/> of ſuch, who had taſted of the ſweetneſſe of the Ordinances, and Houſe of Chriſt, and were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fallen away, not only from them, but alſo from the other principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, would be but in vain attempted.</p>
               <p>This ſharpneſſe of his towards them he againe mollifies, verſe 9. <hi>But we hope better things of you, &amp;c.</hi> Indeavours to comfort them, and exhorts them, in the words next before my Text, to <hi>labour with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for a full aſſurance of hope to the end: And not to be ſlothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the words of my Text he urgeth this duty of laboring for a ful aſſurance of hope upon them, by ſhewing that ground of this aſſurance of hope, which the Saints have from the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that great pattern of Beleevers: and that two ways.

               </p>
               <p>By this we ſee that many things might be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from theſe words by way of obſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the things promiſed in the Goſpel, are by the Saints obtained by inheritance.</hi> Abraham <hi>inherited the promiſe,</hi> and all Beleevers are here called the <hi>Heirs of promiſe. Begotten to a lively hope, to an inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. So <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Brought from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, to receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them who are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt.</hi> And that will be the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſentence from the judge at laſt, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit ye the Kingdom.</hi> Their title is ſure, they cannot loſe their portion, and it is ſo great it muſt be freely given, and by ſuch a Father; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel therefore is his Teſtament: The ſumme of what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118924:14"/> is promiſed therein, is an enjoyment of God himſelf: Thoſe that have it, muſt therefore be his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by union with him in Jeſus Chriſt. And <hi>if Children, then Heirs of God, Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That thoſe who do enjoy this inheritance, by faith and patience they muſt inherit it.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> This work is carryed on by the power of a creating word, and <hi>the word profits not where it is not mixt with faith;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> it is <hi>the power of God to Salvation to them onely that believe.</hi> And becauſe the Lord will take time to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, diſpatching this great work not all at once, but by degrees, therefore <hi>we have need of patience, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done the will of God, we may receive the promiſe,</hi> Heb. 10. 36.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the example of beleevers is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a Chriſtian in beleeving. Abrahams</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is here made the ground of a Chriſtians confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Beleevers are ſaid to walk in the ſteps of</hi> Abrahams <hi>faith.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, and they were not confounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith is a great work, but this incouragement we have; the things to be believed are things of a <hi>common ſalvation, Jude</hi> 3. A duty to which others are obliged as well as we; and that which many thouſands have done before us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſtly in the faith, knowing that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren which are in the world.</hi> So, Col. 1. 23. <hi>If ye continue in the faith, grounded, and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Had it been a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel deviſed onely for you, and ſo you put upon a way of believing by your ſelves, you might then have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118924:14"/> the caſe, and have been unſetled; but it is not ſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That Oaths are lawful, and in ſome caſes a duty among Chriſtians.</hi> God himſelfe ſweareth, and his ſwearing is ſet forth by what is in uſe <hi>amongſt men,</hi> namely, <hi>for confirmation, to put an end to all ſtrife.</hi> When he ſwears, he acts after the manner of man; now if he acts as a man, it ſhall not be in that which is ſinful. He was made like us in all things, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Leut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God and ſerve him, and ſhalt ſwear by his name.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2. whereby we ſee how to underſtand thoſe other places, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 33. <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. namely, that we ſwear not profanely or commonly, but religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as a ſacred work; ſo ſaith our Saviour, let your communication be <hi>yea, yea, nay, nay:</hi> And that we ſwear not by any creature, but by his name; ſuch inſtances are given in both places.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That thoſe who are Beleevers have not onely the Promiſe, but alſo the Oath of God, to reſt their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon.</hi> He loveth to do like himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do the utmoſt for his people: In working, his <hi>right hand teacheth him, Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. and in promiſing and making ſure his promiſe, he doth what may be done for us. <hi>Becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf.</hi> What cauſe have we to be <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſin, becauſe of unbelief,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>John.</hi> 16. 9. ſince God hath done and ſaid ſo much, if we are unbelieving notwithſtanding!</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>That there is a ſtrife or controverſie between God and each uncomfortable ſoul among his people.</hi> Full of diſputes and jealous thoughts we are, which are the cauſe of our diſcomforts; therefore God gives to us his promiſe, and his oath, to be an end of all ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118924:15"/> ſtrife between himſelf and us; <hi>That by two immutable things, wherein it was impoſſible for God to Lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other things might be obſerved; I ſhall name but one obſervation more, and that I ſhall inſiſt upon, and for which I made choice of this Scripture upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>It is this.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>That what the Lord confirmed by Oath to</hi> Abraham, <hi>he confirmed it to us, even to all beleevers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt to the worlds end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> is here brought in as a pattern, and all beleevers are here ſuppoſed to <hi>inherit</hi> the promiſe made to him in common with him; in as much as he ſaith that what God did for <hi>Abraham,</hi> when by Oath he confirmed to him the promiſe of <hi>bleſſing him, and multiplying his ſeed,</hi> he did it <hi>that he might ſhew the immutability of his counſel to the Heirs of promiſe, and that we,</hi> that is the beleevers of the New Teſtament, <hi>might have ſtrong conſolation:</hi> If the promiſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto him, had not been intended and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo unto us, that confirmation of it ſo to him had conduced nothing to our comfort, nor had we been <hi>Heirs of that promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a further proofe of this point, take <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe.</hi> Where we ſee, that what we have in Chriſt, we have it all as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and as heirs with him of the ſame promiſe; and what we have as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, we have it all in Chriſt: ſo as the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is an Epitome or the ſumme of the Goſpel. So <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 55. 72, 73. wee finde that when Chriſt was ſent into the world, and what was done by him, it was to perform the Oath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118924:15"/> of God to <hi>Abraham. He hath holpen his ſervant</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in remembrance of his mercy, as he ſpake to our Fathers, to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed for ever. To perform the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy promiſed, to remember his holy Covenant, the Oath which he ſware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might ſerve him without feare, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A further proofe hereof we have in all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where beleevers of the New Teſtament, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are called <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> becauſe thereby they are all intitled to his promiſe, made as you ſee, to him and his ſeed. As for inſtance, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>To</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made; he ſaith not and to ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Christ. And this I ſay, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after, could not diſanull.</hi> This one ſeed, which is Chriſt, is not meant of Chriſt in his own perſon onely; for then no beleever ſhould be accounted the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely Chriſt; but of Chriſt in his myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>All the members of that one body, being many, are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi> Which bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (ſaith the Apoſtle here) is not made up of two ſeeds, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but of one ſeed, though made up of both. And that he meaneth Chriſt in that ſenſe is evident by that paſſage. <hi>The covenant which was confirmed in Chriſt</hi> 430. <hi>years before, &amp;c.</hi> What before he called <hi>a promiſe made to Chriſt the one ſeed,</hi> he afterward calleth a <hi>covenant confirmed in Chriſt,</hi> namely, to us in him as members of his body, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> therefore this one ſeed, which is Chriſt, is meant of Chriſt in his myſtical body.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118924:16"/> By which it appeareth that the promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was confirmed to beleevers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as his ſeed. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Therefore is it of faith that it might be of grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed; not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>who is the father of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another proofe is that in Pſal. 105. 6. <hi>O ye ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>his ſervant, ye children of</hi> Jacob <hi>his choſen; he hath remembred his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thouſand Generations, ſaying, unto thee will I give the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of thine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> If any branch of Gods promiſe unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> may ſeem to be meant onely of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not of the New, it is this of the Land of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>I will give unto thee and to thy ſeed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I wil be their God.</hi> Yet is it expreſly ſaid that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was <hi>a Covenant for ever, a word commanded for a thouſand Generations,</hi> and <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion:</hi> which needs muſt extend to the times of the Goſpel, becauſe elſe it had been only <hi>for thrice fourteen Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rations. Matth.</hi> 1. 17. And we know that <hi>Canaan</hi> hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> natural ſeed. Thus alſo the Apoſtle ſayth here. That the promiſe and oath which we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworne, that bleſſing I will bleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the Queſtion be, what that is which is contained in that promiſe concerning <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be <hi>an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſion</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and the Lord to be their God, which is to be fulfilled in the times of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is all that of which <hi>Canaan</hi> and the good things thereof was a type, namely, the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſings of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Church of the New Teſtament, yea of Heaven it ſelfe. And for the proofe hereof,</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſomething we have in that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. where the Prophet ſpeaketh of the Church of the New Teſtament under the type of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſaith, The Strangers are appointed the lot of their inheritance with the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Verſe 22. <hi>They ſhall have inheritance with you, among the Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Not in the Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly repreſented by it. So <hi>Eſai.</hi> 65. 9. <hi>Mine Elect ſhall inherit it, and my Servants ſhall dwell there, and</hi> Sharon <hi>ſhall be a field of Flocks.</hi> Speaking of the Church of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve that <hi>Abraham</hi> accordingly did by faith embrace that promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be an everlaſting poſſeſſion to him and his ſeed, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe referring to, and including not onely an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo an heavenly inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8. 9. 10. The reaſon there rendred by the Apoſtle, why by faith <hi>he left his own country, went into the Land of promiſe, and lived there with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in Tents as ſtrangers,</hi> is given v. 10. <hi>becauſe he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> So v. 13. 14. 15. 16. in what they did and ſaid, when they <hi>counted themſelves ſtrangers and pilgrims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they declared, that they did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118924:17"/> ſeek a better country, that is to ſay, an heavenly.</hi> Then mark what followeth; <hi>Wherefore he is not aſhamed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their God:</hi> namely, in that which he did in full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his promiſe; implying that if it had been onely an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which by promiſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, it had not been worthy of him to give as their God. In this the Apoſtle interprets that promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>To thee and to thy ſeed will I give the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God;</hi> That is, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles interpretation, he would be ſo in giving them not onely an earthly, but alſo an heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo as together with thoſe earthly bleſſings, he would beſtow himſelfe upon them.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought their firſt fruits to the place which God did chuſe to place his name there, and were there to make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment before the Prieſt, of the fulfilling of that promiſe, and were required to <hi>rejoyce there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord their God, for every good thing which the Lord their God had given them, Deut.</hi> 26. 1. to 11. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters do well refer it not onely to temporal, but alſo to the ſpiritual good things, whereof they were a type; becauſe the good things were ſuch as God is there ſuppoſed to give them as their God. And becauſe not onely their <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> thus given to God, but alſo <hi>the whole lump was holy. Rom.</hi> 11. 16. which implyeth that they had not onely a natural, but alſo a ſacred and religious uſe of their eſtates in <hi>Canaan;</hi> And becauſe this whole action was an act of ſolemne worſhip, in which the type and the thing typified always go together.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo is it that <hi>Eſau</hi> is branded for a <hi>profane perſon</hi> for <hi>ſelling his birthright</hi> to this promiſe. Had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118924:17"/> it been onely of a temporal, and not of a ſpiritual <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> alſo, there had been nothing of profaneſſe in it; which alwayes is a contempt, or neglect of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpiritual. And his ſin is made the ſame with theirs who <hi>ſell their birthright now for a morſel of meat. Heb.</hi> 12. 16. which thoſe beleevers do, who for worldly advantages forgo their priviledges in the Church and houſe of God; and of ſuch the Apoſtle meaneth it, as is evident by the ſcope of the place, and of the whole Epiſtle, as was ſhewed before, and not of wicked men, for their birthright is nothing elſe but death and hell.</p>
               <p>To this I may add what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. chapters: namely, that the Lords offer to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, to carry them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to deſtroy the inhabitants before them, and that in performance of his promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 24. with 3. 6. 8. &amp; 6. 8. Numb. 14. 23. Matth. 11 29.</note> was a <hi>preaching of the Goſpel to them,</hi> chap. 4. 2. 3. And whereas the Goſpel is a promiſe of reſt in God through Chriſt, to every beleever, he ſaith alſo, that it was an offer to them of an entrance <hi>into Gods own reſt.</hi> And when he ſware that they ſhould not ſee the good Land, concerning which he ſware unto their Fathers, and that their carcaſes ſhould fall in the wilderneſſe; this, by the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 95. and by the Apoſtle in that place, is called a <hi>ſwearing againſt them in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> Which could not have beene ſaid, unleſſe in that promiſe the ſpiritual bleſſings of the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> alſo had been comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which, albeit I ſuppoſe by that which hath been ſaid, is evident to an impartial mind, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo many ſtumble at this miſtake, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning <hi>Canaan</hi> was no Goſpel promiſe, nor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118924:18"/> to be in any part fulfilled in the times of the New Teſtament; and becauſe the vindication of this truth is of concernment to our work in hand, I ſhal ſtay a little in opening this Scripture.</p>
               <p>For which purpoſe, let us conſider the words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>With whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that ſinned, whoſe carcaſſes fell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> It ſhould rather have been rendred thus, <hi>Whom had he in diſdain forty years?</hi>

And to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that believed not? So we ſee they could not enter in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of unbelief.</hi> He goes on chap. 4. 1. <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his rest, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it; for unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them; but the word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle maketh their caſe and ours to he the ſame; the Goſpel preached alike to both, and the ſucceſſe to be alike, in caſe the word preached be not mixed with faith in them that hear it; as it did not profit them, ſo alſo that it will not profit us. Now that we may diſcover the mind of the Apoſtle herein, and how that offer of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them was a preaching of the Goſpel, as was ſaid;</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt have recourſe to, and conſider what was ſaid in ſhewing the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, pag. 1.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he writeth this Epiſtle to ſuch as did profeſſe the faith of Chriſt. Secondly, that they were forſaking the worſhip of the New Teſtament; and that a main ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle is to prevent and cure this apoſtaſie. And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe how he telleth them, that the Lords people are his houſe, chap. 3. 6. And exhorts them, in the words
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118924:19"/> of the Holy Ghoſt, therefore to hear the voice of Chriſt, the <hi>Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting us to celebrate his day of reſt in his houſe, in the Worſhip of the Goſpel. And how he argues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject in thoſe two Chapters, the third and fourth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider yet moreover, that beleevers are the houſe of Gods reſt in a two-fold capacity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, as <hi>members of the myſtical body of Chriſt,</hi> or of the inviſible Church; and ſo, as Homogeneal parts of that body, they are his houſe, not only as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectivly taken together with the whole family of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 19. 20. 21. but alſo ſingly, each beleever is his houſe, as every drop of water is water, as well as the Sea is water, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, John.</hi> 9. 56. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As in a <hi>Miniſteriall body,</hi> or a viſible Church; and ſo they are his houſe onely in the way of an Ordinance; as the bread in the Lords ſupper is his body, ſo alſo the Church, or ſociety wherein we worſhip God, is his body and his houſe only in the way of an Ordinance, that is, as the ſupper of the Lord is that Ordinance, wherin we enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body and blood of Chriſt, and he ſaith of the Bread and Wine, <hi>this is my body,</hi> and <hi>this is my blood;</hi> that is, it is equivalently ſo, or in effect the body and blood of Chriſt unto his people: ſo the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church or Congregation, whereof we are a part, and wherein we worſhip God, is that Ordinance, wherein we enjoy the comforts, and perform thoſe duties, which belong to us as members of the body of Chriſt; and is in equivalency, or in effect, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118924:19"/> myſtical body or houſe of Chriſt unto us; ſo as wee have as much therein, in our worſhiping God, as if all <hi>the family of heaven and earth</hi> were therein met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and onely they. In this ſecond capacity the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is called the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. and the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is called his <hi>Houſe, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly conſider alſo, that as we are the houſe of Gods reſt in this two-fold capacity, ſo accordingly, in the ſame two-fold capacity, have we an entrance into this reſt of God offered to us in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt in our perſonal intereſt, as beleevers, and as members of the myſtical body of Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the publick and ſollemn Worſhip, or Service of his houſe, and ſanctifying of his Sabbaths, both which the Lord hath ordained and ſanctified, to be means wherein our perſonal intereſt is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and wherein we have a more full enjoyment of this reſt in God, through Jeſus Chriſt. Now this our entrance into his reſt, as his houſe in this ſecond capacity, is that which the Apoſtle chiefly ſpeaketh to here when he ſaith; <hi>Take heed brethren of an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> And that in caſe the people of his paſture, and Sheep of his hand, even his own children, will not hear his voice, but forſake his worſhip, refuſing his offer in this Goſpel reſt, as they did in the <hi>Canaan</hi> reſt, he will alſo <hi>ſwear againſt them,</hi> as he did againſt theſe, <hi>that they ſhall not enter into his reſt.</hi> And bids them <hi>fear, leaſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of them ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every true beleever, as conſidered in the firſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, hath reſt in God through Chriſt by faith, from which he ſhall never totally fall. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118924:20"/> in the other capacity, as he hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his enjoyment of this his reſt, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it upon the day of his reſt, in the ſervice of his houſe the worſhip of the Goſpel: ſo of this a beleever may come ſhort, and ſhall, in caſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes that holy profeſſion. In this ſence therefore it is called a departure from the living God, chap. 3. 12. becauſe it is a departing from him, as to what a beleever doth enjoy in this ſecond capacity; a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from him in <hi>tanto,</hi> though not in <hi>toto,</hi> in part though not in whole; and in ſo doing he will ſeem to come ſhort alſo of the other, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>leaſt any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> for although in his perſonal intereſt and capacity, he enjoyeth his reſt in Chriſt, by faith, yet there will be little appearance of it unto others, if not as little alſo to his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>And the caſe herein was juſt the ſame with them who fell in the Wilderneſſe; for though they did not enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet many of them went to Heaven, and in their perſonal intereſt by faith did enjoy reſt in God in this life too. <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> were in the number; and they could ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt been our dwelling place in all Generations,</hi> as in the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal. 90. 1. And the ſin of thoſe that refuſed to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> is called an Apoſtaſie from God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 9. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the ſpeech of <hi>Caleb</hi> to the people, <hi>be not ye Apoſtates from the Lord;</hi> ſo the Septuagint hath it, whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Apoſtle followeth in this place.</p>
               <p>And by that which hath been ſaid appeareth the reaſon, why the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>to us was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached, as well as unto them,</hi> and therein ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that it was preached too to them as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118924:20"/> us: becauſe as the Goſpel is a promiſe of reſt in God, through Chriſt by faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. ſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of this reſt, in the ſervice of his houſe upon his day, is a part of that Goſpel and promiſe: And as we enjoy it in the Ordinances and Sabbath of the New Teſtament; ſo did they the very ſame reſt, in the Sabbaths and the Ordinances of the Old, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the bleſſings thereof, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of, and protection from their Enemies was a part. Therefore his offer of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them was an offer of an entrance into his reſt, and ſo a preaching of the Goſpel to them. As it was the will of God to adminiſter the covenant of grace, in the times of the Old Teſtament, by types and ſhadows, ſo not only by other types, but alſo by this of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus their paſſing from <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Sea, and their being relieved by water out of the Rock in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, were but types, yet ſuch as therein they did enjoy the ſame communion with God in Chriſt, as beleevers now enjoy in the Ordinances of the New Teſtament, Baptiſme, or the Supper of the Lord. And <hi>that Rock was Chriſt,</hi> as well as the Bread in that Supper is his Body, as we ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And their caſe the ſame with ours, in point of ſin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as here it is made by the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. as to one that reads and conſiders that tenth chapter eaſily appears. Therefore alſo whether the conqueſt of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not a Church action, as well as other ſervices of the houſe of the Old Teſtament, let it be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why we may ſo judge is, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>ſubdued thoſe kingdoms by faith; Heb.</hi> 11. but alſo, becauſe it was the execution of a Sentence of Anathema, ſo as the deſtruction of the inhabitants

                  <note place="margin">Joſhua. 22.</note> and the halfe tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> about the Altar which they thought they had built for worſhip, which (had it been ſo as they ſuppoſed) had been a tranſgreſſion to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even as the ſetting up of an Idol; This caſe is made by the congregation, in their dealing with them about it by their meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, parallel with that of <hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Peor,</hi> wherein the whole congregation ſuffered for the ſin of ſome few, and was delivered from wrath by puniſhing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
               <p>By that which hath been ſaid, we ſee, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be a poſſeſſion to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, is a Goſpel promiſe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> looked upon it as ſuch; and that in performance thereof his ſpiritual ſeed did enjoy not onely an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but withall an heavenly, even in the times of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; which heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> as it is yet in being and ſhall be, and enjoyed by the ſame ſpiritual ſeed ſtill, ſo we are to look upon that promiſe, as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo for us of the New Teſtament, in all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>In this manner hath the Lord been pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Goſpel to believers; he hath ſingled out <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> as a pattern, and confirmed it to him, and in him to us as his ſeed. And it hath been his uſual courſe thus to do. As for inſtance, when he gave that great promiſe, of conquering the enemies of the bleſſed ſeed by conquering God in prayer, he gave it firſt to <hi>Jacob,</hi> when upon occaſion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in wreſtling with God he called him <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And from him do we at this day claim the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and are called by that name the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118924:22"/> God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Peace be on them and on the Iſrael of God.</hi> So when he gave unto his Saints the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, he gave them to <hi>Peter,</hi> and that his new Name in order thereunto, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 18. He had his name before given, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 42. but there he gives him the reaſon of his new Name, and the comfort of it; and from that gift to <hi>Peter</hi> the Saints do claim their Church power, each according to their place and ſtation in the Church; for they have it as <hi>Peters,</hi> that is, as ſtones in that building, or if you will, as confeſſours, which makes them to be Stones in the houſe of God. And as perſons are more or leſſe eminent in that work, ſo have they more or leſſe of that power; therefore the Officers of the Church are intruſted with the greateſt ſhare. So here alſo he ſingles out <hi>Abraham,</hi> and confirmeth that to him which he intendeth to beſtow upon all beleevers, and gives him alſo his new name upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The reaſons why he hath done thus, I ſhall ſhew anon. But before we come to them, for our more clear proceeding, let us firſt conſider what this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and what is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here reciteth that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. where the words are theſe; <hi>By my ſelf have</hi> I <hi>ſworne, that bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed, as the ſtars of Heaven, and as the ſand by the Sea ſhore, and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the gate of his enemies.</hi> The Apoſtle here, for brevity ſake, ſets down but two things, <hi>Gods bleſſing Abraham, and his multiplying his ſeed:</hi> his ſcope in this place being, not ſo much to ſet out the full extent and compaſs of the matter of <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe, but onely the manner of Gods confirming it by an oath: therefore if you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118924:22"/> will have a juſt account of that promiſe, you muſt take it as it is ſet down in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> not only in chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 22. 16. but alſo in other places, eſpecially in the twelfth and ſeventeenth chapters: for the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is ſeveral times repeated, and by various expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſet forth. And it containeth four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in general, that God would <hi>bleſs</hi> Abraham, <hi>and with him all beleevers, the heirs of his promiſe, with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, as Children and Heirs of God,</hi> Rom. 9. 7. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> that is, (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are accounted for the ſeed.</hi> By which we ſee, the bleſſing which God beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with him upon all beleevers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>bleſſing I will bleſs thee, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 2. is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Gods children, namely, all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus. As alſo we find <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. that the <hi>covenant and promiſe made to Abraham, was confirmed to us in Christ;</hi> and to this promiſe <hi>the Law was added, four hundred and thirty years after.</hi> And it is called <hi>a preaching of the Goſpel to Abraham.</hi> v. 8. even in what was ſaid, In thee ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed. <hi>The Scripture</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, In thee ſhall all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be bleſſed. So that they which be of faith are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> And you ſee the bleſſing is their being juſtified by Chriſt. Again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe.</hi> So as look what bleſſings we have in Chriſt, they are all wrapped up in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and it was intended by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118924:23"/> Lord to comprehend (as was ſaid before) the ſumme of the Goſpel. This I ſay, in general, was intended in the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 5. 15.</note> and herein his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe did not differ from that promiſe made unto our firſt parents, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, More particularly, in Gods promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham</hi> is contained ſomething peculiar unto him, and which beleevers are to claim particularly from his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> as namely, in the ſecond place, that God would not onely bleſſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him all beleevers, but alſo would make them bleſſings; and that chiefly and in the firſt place to their <hi>familis;</hi> and not onely ſo but alſo to <hi>Nations,</hi> Gen. 12. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, and in thee ſhall all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies oj the earth be bleſſed.</hi> So Gen. 18. 18. <hi>All the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in Abraham.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>Peter</hi> alledgeth and explaineth to the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God made with our Fathers, ſaying unto</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Kindreds of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> The word is all the families of the earth, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The ſame word <hi>we have,</hi> Epeſ. 3. 15. <hi>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> The covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore, as by this place we ſee, that we have it in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1: where it was firſt made &amp; given, ſo alſo that it reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth families and poſterity; elſe he had ſaid all the beleevers, or all the people of the earth, not all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth, ſhall be bleſſed. And he could not have ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ye are the children of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, had it not reſpected the children of the people of God. Nor is it to be reſtrained only to the <hi>Jews;</hi> for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118924:23"/> the promiſe is concerning all the families of the Earth. Therefore it followeth in the next words, v. 26. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son, hath ſent him to bleſs you;</hi> therefore to others he was ſent alſo, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to bleſſe them. What we have as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, we have it all in Chriſt, as was ſhewed before; therefore he is ſaid to come to bleſſe the children of the covenant, the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt, and afterwards the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> And this bleſſing, as it is firſt laid down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and here repeated by the Apoſtle, wee ſee is a bleſſing both upon the people of God themſelves, and upon their families.</p>
               <p>Nor is this promiſe to be reſtrained only unto this, that of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed the Lord Chriſt ſhould come, (although that alſo be included, becauſe what we receive from <hi>Abraham,</hi> we have it all in Chriſt) for ſo all thoſe of the line of Chriſt were bleſſings to the world as well as he. And becauſe here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intended applicable to all beleevers, namely that they alſo ſhall be bleſſings in their generations; And becauſe a bleſſing upon families is intended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for ſo the words run, <hi>thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay it muſt not be ſo reſtrained.</p>
               <p>But the meaning is, whereas the Lord in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and ſalvation upon the ſons of men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not according to their merit, either in being or foreſeen, but according to his own free-choice; that in his covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> he hath thus far limited himſelfe, and diſcovered his mind and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that his choice ſhall not be proportionably all over the world alike, but that it ſhall be by families and nations; ſo as he will ordinarily caſt elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon elect parents; and the lot of the Saints in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118924:24"/> neighbourhoods and places together, and not by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual numbers, in each part of the world alike. Had not his election been ſo limited to families and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, neither <hi>Abraham</hi> nor beleevers could have been ſaid to be bleſſings, in ſpiritual things, either to their families, or to any other where they live; as now they are, becauſe God ſo bleſſeth only his Elect, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Hee hath bleſſed us according as he hath choſen us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a further proof that this alſo is one part of Gods promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him confirmed unto all beleevers, it is not to be omitted that, <hi>de facto</hi> in experience, we have found it ſo. In all ages God hath caſt it ſo in his providence, that his people are not to be found in all places alike; but we find them together in ſome <hi>families</hi> and <hi>nations.</hi> Now this is not fallen out by chance, but becauſe God hath ſo made his choice, hath been a <hi>God to beleevers and to their ſeed, in their Generations;</hi> and hath made them bleſſings, for the converſion and edification of their children, neighbours, and acquaintance, and that not onely by a common providence, as he bleſſeth the corn and graſſe of the field, (although it muſt be granted that in an ordinary way of cauſes, good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and example is a great advantage towards the ſeaſoning of the hearts of little ones, with the knowledge and love of Chriſt) but it is by vertue of a ſpecial <hi>word of bleſſing,</hi> a creating word of <hi>promiſe,</hi> which giveth a being to the things promiſed, even this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; <hi>Bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> without which, ſuch examples and other means of education and converſion had not had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118924:24"/> ſuch efficacy and power in turning ſinners unto God.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, let us ſee what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture faith further for a proofe hereof. That in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. mentioned before, ſpeaketh ſomething to it, where it is ſaid, that Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>a word which he hath commanded to a thouſand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:</hi> which phraſe implyeth that it ſhould be a bleſſing conferred upon poſterity, from generation to generation, according to that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, to be a God to thee and thy ſeed after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which maketh it more clear is that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, upon the converſion of <hi>Zacheus; Luke.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>Now is ſalvation come into this houſe, for as much as he alſo is become a ſon of Abraham.</hi> Salvation was not onely come into his ſoul, but alſo into his houſe, and upon that account. And for the ſame reaſon it was that <hi>Paul</hi> could uſe that argument to the jaylour, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe,</hi> namely, becauſe of this promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God would bleſſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with him beleevers as his ſeed, and make them bleſſings to their families: ſo as the converſion of the father of the family would bring ſalvation into his houſe.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe alſo is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>If the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving of them be but life from the dead? For if the firſt fruits be holy, the lump alſo is holy; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> He ſpeaks it of the calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and putteth it upon this: He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers to be an holy root, as we ſee verſe 28. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118924:25"/> for your ſake, but as touching the election they are beloved for the Fathers ſake; for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> are broken off from this holy root, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are graffed into the ſame root, and the time is comming when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be graffed in again, and that for the Fathers ſake, and becauſe the gift once given to them God will not repent of.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that graffiing into the holy root, is to be underſtood of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being brought into the Church: I anſwer, it comes all to one; for the church bringeth fourth children unto Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which then was, is ſaid to have <hi>her Children;</hi> who adhering to the letter of the Law, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Goſpel which was typified and ſhadowed therein, ſought to be juſtified by the works of the Law; born therefore, as <hi>Iſhamel was by Agar,</hi> onely <hi>after the fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Jeruſalem which is above, which is the mother of us all,</hi> hath her children alſo; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by faith, are brought forth, <hi>as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was by</hi> Sarah, <hi>by promiſe.</hi> But whether it be the one or the other, we ſee that both ſorts of children are brought forth to <hi>Abraham.</hi> All the children of the Church are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Therefore I ſay it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all to one.</p>
               <p>Nor may we ſay that Chriſt only is this holy root, into which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are graffed; becauſe it had been no argument to ſay, Becauſe Chriſt is holy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jews</hi> are or ſhall be holy, and therefore ſhall be converted. But, make <hi>Abraham</hi> that holy root, and the argument is good. And becauſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> which are to be converted cannot be ſaid to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches to Chriſt, as to their own root, as they are ſaid to be to that root of which the Apoſtle
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118924:25"/> ſpeaks; namely, by reaſon of their relation to it, as branches of it. So as this bleſſing upon families and kindreds, and his ordering in ſuch manner his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as hath been ſhewed, as by this Scripture you ſee, it was intended in the promiſe unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſo alſo that it is ſtill in being, and ſhall be to a thouſand generations, to all generations (ſo I ſuppoſe we are to underſtand that phraſe, Pſal. 105.) even to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Which will yet be more evident, if we compare this <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. with <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59. 20. For the Apoſtle cites that place, to prove the converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be expected in the latter days. v. 26. <hi>So all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, There ſhall come out of</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. <hi>For this is my Covenant unto them</hi> (namely, the Jews) <hi>when I ſhall take away their ſins,</hi> that is, <hi>when they are called, and ingraffed again into their own Olive tree, from which for a long time they have been broken off.</hi> Now if we look into <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59. we ſee there what this covenant is, <hi>viz.</hi> in the words next following at verſ. 21. <hi>This is my covenant with them,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, even for ever.</hi> Then mark what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirmeth hereupon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel, they are enemies for your ſake, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſake; for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> So as it is the purpoſe of God's election, thus made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which entay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thus his bleſſing upon families from generation to generation; which, as by this of the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118924:26"/> compared with that of the Apoſtle, it appeareth, that it ſhall be verified even to the converted <hi>Jews</hi> in the latter days: ſo by the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. we find that this priviledge is no other then what is and hath been enjoyed by beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſince their being graffed into the ſame root and Olive tree from whence the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe alſo the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>children of beleevers,</hi> that <hi>they are holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the repenting <hi>Jews</hi> to be <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> becauſe <hi>the promiſe was to them and to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Acts.</hi> 2. 38. Both which places I ſhall open in the application; namely, this in the third uſe of the point, the other in the fourth.</p>
               <p>A further evidence of this truth, that in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God with <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed to his people ſuch a bleſſing upon poſterity, we have from the nature and uſe of circumciſion, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the child, as a neceſſary and eſſential part of that ordinance; <note place="margin">Gen. 17: 10: 14.</note> this branch of the promiſe, concerning the circumciſion of the heart of the ſeed of his people, being thereby ſignified and ſealed.

               <p>Secondly, There is an evident reaſon, why not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God hath promiſed ſuch a bleſſing upon beleevers, their families and children, yet that ſometimes this bleſſing ſhould not take effect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſometimes family duties are neglected; beleevers ſometimes follow not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſteps, in faith and obedience, and in cloſe walking with God, as his ſervants and friends, as they ought to do; and then no wonder if ſuch perſons and their children come ſhort of this bleſſing, becauſe God who ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the end, ordaineth alſo to the means; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of ſuch Parents by ſuch example will be apt to grow remiſſe and careleſſe in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, although his promiſe be to carry his election ſo, as to caſt elect children upon elect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: yet he reſerveth to himſelfe, and alſo uſeth, in this, a liberty, namely, ever and anon to be ſtill break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118924:27"/> off ſome, and graffing in others into this holy root. So he paſſed by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and took <hi>Iſaac:</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Eſau,</hi> and took <hi>Jacob:</hi> afterwards he brake off the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and graffed in the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> at laſt he will graff the <hi>Jews</hi> again into their owne root. So now a days a beleevers child proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; then is that child broken off: an unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers child is converted to the faith; then is that child graffed into this holy root. Therefore, for a right underſtanding of this promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> we muſt take in that caution or qualification to it. And it was neceſſary, as God hath ſo farre confined himſelf in his election, namely, to families and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he ſhould withal reſerve this liberty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he had ſo entayled his election to beleevers families, as that none of their poſterity ſhould ever be broken off, very many and great inconveniences, through mans corruption, would enſue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing conteined in the Lords promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> is, <hi>That by thus bleſſing, and making be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers bleſſings, God would multiply his ſeed,</hi> Gen. 22. 16. <hi>Bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and multiplying I will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>I will make my covenant between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly; and</hi> v. 5. <hi>Neither ſhall thy name any more be called</hi> Abram, <hi>but thy name ſhall be</hi> Abraham. <hi>for a Father of many Nations have I made thee.</hi> This alſo is part of the Goſpel and conteined in the promiſe made to him and us, as we may ſee further by that which is here expreſſed in the Text. When the Apoſtle would give inſtance of what God had confirmed by oath to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might ſhew the immutability of his counſel to the Heirs of promiſe, and that we might have ſtrong conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118924:27"/> he gives that for one, the multiplying of his ſeed.</p>
               <p>A further proofe we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Look now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and tell the Stars, if thou be able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them; and he ſaid unto him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham beleeved</hi> (it is ſaid) <hi>and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> This the Apoſtle bringeth to prove juſtification by free grace, through faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. 18. 22. Therefore that multiplying of his ſeed promiſed in thoſe words, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> had reference not onely to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo to believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the increaſe of whoſe number by means of Gods bleſſing believers ſo as to make them bleſſings, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, was intended in that promiſe, and as part of that <hi>Goſpel</hi> which God <hi>preached</hi> unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> elſe his beleeving it had not been <hi>imputed for righteouſneſſe,</hi> nor the Apoſtle alledged it to prove juſtification by faith in Chriſt, as he doth in that place.</p>
               <p>Again, we know that one great promiſe to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers now under the New Teſtament, is, that the kingdome of Chriſt, that is, the Church at laſt ſhall fill the world. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>The ſtone cut out without hands, which ſmote the image upon the feet, and brake to pieces the Iron, and the Clay, the Braſſe, the Silver, and the Gold, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</hi> And the ſtone is interpreted of the kingdome of Chriſt, v. 44. To this purpoſe is that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 31. comparing the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but when it is grown is the greateſt of all herbs.</hi> And that it is <hi>like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meale, till the whole was leavened.</hi> Now the Lords making beleevers bleſſings, and thereby
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118924:28"/> multiplying <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, is that which makes his kingdome thus to be like <hi>leaven,</hi> whereby the whole world at laſt will be ſeaſoned with the knowledge, and love of Chriſt. Therefore this multiplying of beleevers, ſo as to fill the world, is made by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13.) to be part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe. <hi>The promiſe that he ſhould be Heir of the World was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi> Then mark what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, v. 16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be ſure to all the ſeed; not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the Father of us all; as it is written, I have made thee the Father of many Nations. Who againſt hope, beleeved in hope, that he might be the Father of many Nations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which was ſpoken, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be, namely, as the ſtars of heaven for number.</hi> From theſe words obſerve, Firſt, that <hi>Abraham</hi> by the promiſes given unto him was made the Heir of the world. Secondly, that the promiſe of multiplying his ſeed, in thoſe words, <hi>I will make thee a Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> was one promiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was ſo made the Heir of the world. Thirdly, that this promiſe of multiplying his ſeed, and of his thereby being made the Heir of the world, was not made to <hi>Abraham</hi> or his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſſe of faith; therefore a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſe. Fourthly, that this promiſe was made ſure to all beleevers, as well <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. A fourth thing conteined in <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe, confirmed both to him and all beleevers, is, <hi>that his ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies,</hi> Gen. 22. 16. The place here cited by the Apoſtle in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118924:28"/> Text, as intended alſo to the Heirs of promiſe in the New Teſtament. <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworn</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of the heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the Sea-ſhore; and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies;</hi> that is, their power and authority. For as gates were for defence, ſo they were places of judgement. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establiſh judgement in the gate.</hi> Deut. 16. 18. <hi>Judges ſhalt thou make in all thy gates.</hi> Dan. 2. 49. <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, were ſet over the affairs of the provinces, but</hi> Daniel <hi>ſat in the gate of the King.</hi> This therefore was Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that by means of this bleſſing he would ſo multiply his ſeed, as they ſhould not only fill, they ſhould alſo ſubdue the world at laſt, and raign over it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 3. <hi>He ſhall ſubdue the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us. Rev.</hi> 11. 15. The Kingdomes of this world ſhall be the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18. 28. <hi>The Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this you may obſerve is reduced to <hi>Abrahams</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. (which is a parallel prophecy to that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.) <hi>O clap your hands all ye people, ſhout unto God with the voice of triumph; for the Lord moſt High is the King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the earth. He ſhall ſubdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. God raigneth over the heathen, God ſitteth upon the Throne of his Holineſſe.</hi> Then mark what followeth; <hi>The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of</hi> Abraham. All this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power therfore is confirmed upon them as his ſeed, and heirs of his promiſe. And although by what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118924:29"/> hath been ſaid it is evident that this alſo is one branch of Gods promiſe made to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Yet, I ſhall adde one place more, wherein (with ſubmiſſion, I ſuppoſe) we have alſo a propheſie, of what God wil do for his people in this kind, and all reduced ſtill to his promiſe unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, a Pſalm made upon occaſion of <hi>Davids</hi> bringing the Ark to the Tabernacle, which he had prepared for it upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as we ſee 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 1, 7. in which accordingly we have a propheſie, foreſhewing what God will do when he ſhall <hi>ſet his King upon his holy hill of Sion;</hi> having daſhed <hi>his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in pieces like a Potters veſſel;</hi> even when the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth are become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> In which propheſie obſerve two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how he putteth all that he ſaith therein, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods promiſe unto <hi>Abraham. O give thanks unto the Lord, make known his deeds among the people, ſing unto him, talk of his wonderous works, O ye ſeed of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>his ſervant, ye children of</hi> Jacob <hi>his choſen.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, v. 8. <hi>Which covenant he made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and his oath unto</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and confirmed the ſame to</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſaying, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee will</hi> I <hi>give the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of your inheritance.</hi> And verſe 42. what the Lord did for his people, was, that <hi>he remembred his holy promiſe, and</hi> Abraham <hi>his ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve what he ſaith of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, namely, by ſetting down what God had already done, in fulfilling his promiſe unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells what he would do afterwards in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way; and that he doth by three types. Firſt before they went into <hi>Egypt, when they were but few, rebuking Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118924:29"/> anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi> From verſe 12. to 15. Secondly, the hiſtory of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> from v. 16. to 22. which he bringeth in with a <hi>moreover,</hi> as being an inſtance of the like nature. He being ſold by his brethren, for a ſeaſon was <hi>in priſon, in fetters of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; until the time that his word came,</hi> namely, that what God had promiſed was to be fulfilled. <hi>Then the King ſent and took him, and made him ruler over</hi> Egypt; <hi>to bind his Princes at his pleaſure, and teach his Senatours wiſdom.</hi> Thirdly the hiſtory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> brought in with an <hi>alſo,</hi> as being another inſtance of that kind. Firſt, in a ſtate of ſervitude, then afterwards the <hi>Egyptians deſtroyed for</hi> Iſraels <hi>ſake, they brought out with riches, and</hi> Canaan <hi>given them, that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ſtatutes, and keep his laws.</hi> Under theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thus given, I ſuppoſe, you have a propheſie, of what God will do for his people now, in the times of the Goſpel, namely, however kept under and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for a ſeaſon, yet at laſt the dominion ſhall be theirs, poſſeſſing the gate of their enemies. The Lords rebuking Kings, advancing <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> deſtroying <hi>Egypt,</hi> delivering his people, caſting out the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> were types of all this; as appeareth, not onely in that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was a Prophet, and that <hi>Iſrael</hi> then was a type of <hi>Iſrael</hi> now under the Goſpel, and their <hi>Canaan</hi> a type of ours; but alſo becauſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in his Preface, v. 8. ſpeaketh of that which followeth in the Pſalm, as wherein God <hi>remembred his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thouſand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, which covenant be made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and confirmed the ſame to</hi> Jacob <hi>for a Law, and to</hi> Iſrael <hi>for an everlaſting covenant:</hi> which could not have been ſaid, had not he intended to do the ſame things over againe, in the times of the Goſpel, which he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118924:30"/> then did for his people; and what he did then to be a type of what he would againe doe in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way. It had not been worth the while for the ſpirit of God, onely to repeat the Hiſtory, having ſet that down at large already long before; but (with ſubmiſſion, I ſay, to better judgments) I ſuppoſe, in theſe hiſtories the ſpirit of God intended a ſample, &amp; propheſie of what God will do for his oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the laſt, namely, he will cauſe them to <hi>poſſeſſe the gate of their enemies: and that in remembrance of his holy promiſe, and of</hi> Abraham <hi>his ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore you may obſerve how it is ſaid, that the Hiſtory of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them in the Wilderneſſe, and in <hi>Canaan,</hi> conſiſteth of Parables, and dark ſayings. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 1. <hi>Hearken my people to my Law, I will open my mouth in a Parable,</hi> I <hi>will utter dark ſayings of old.</hi> What are theſe dark ſayings? Namely, he repeateth the Hiſtory of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, and in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> Now Hiſtories, of themſelves, are very eaſie to be underſtood; but it ſeemes there was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in thoſe Records, beſides the bare Hiſtory, namely, that it contained types, and ſamples of what God would do again, after Chriſt, and that in a more ſpiritual way. And you may obſerve, by comparing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 2. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 35. that the Evangeliſt affirmeth that 78. <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be a propheſie of Chriſt, inſtructing his Diſciples in the Law. For when Chriſt had been teaching the people by parables, what the ſeveral ſorts of hearers may expect, each according to their kind and their cariage in that work, he ſaith, that this the Lord Chriſt did, <hi>that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, ſaying, I will open my mouth in Parables, I will utter things which have been
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118924:30"/> kept ſecret from the foundation of the world.</hi> Upon the ſame account this 105. Pſalm is a propheſie, although it ſeemeth to give us but the repetition of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That ſeventy eight <hi>Pſalm</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to more fully by and by.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, from that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. that what is ſaid of the conqueſt of the world by the kingdome of Chriſt, is alſo a part of that promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed. And that we find it to be a part thereof, not onely in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies:</hi> But alſo in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>I will give to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God.</hi> For a further clearing hereof, namely, that in that promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be an everlaſting poſſeſſion to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that conqueſt is intended;</p>
               <p>Firſt, let it be conſidered, that we have already found in that promiſe that which maketh it a Goſpel promiſe, to be fulfilled in the times of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: namely, the ſpiritual bleſſings of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof that land and the good things thereof was a type. p. 23. Now one part of thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of the ſpiritual ſeed, whereby the whole world at laſt ſhall be filled, and ſubdued unto Chriſt, as hath been ſhewed. Therefore if the ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> be intended in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the conqueſt of the world by <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeed cannot be excluded. Moreover becauſe this conqueſt is to be a ſpirituall work, to be effected by the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God, including therfore alſo a conqueſt of ſin, and an injoyment had of the bleſſings of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the kingdom
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118924:31"/> of Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore this conqueſt is it ſelf a part of thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings. And what God did for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in that Land, was alſo a type thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I may adde, that it will not be denyed, but that in the conqueſt of the earthly <hi>Canaan, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed was made to <hi>poſſeſſe the ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of their enemies,</hi> and by that it will appear that thoſe two places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. concerning the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the enemies gate, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. touching <hi>Canaan</hi> to be an everlaſting poſſeſſion, are parallel, both ſpeaking to the ſame thing. Which being ſo, as the Apoſtle here in my Text, by citing, and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our conſolation, that oath of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. concerning the multiplying of his ſeed, and cauſing it to poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies, hath fixed the fulfilling of that promiſe alſo upon the times of the New Teſtament; ſo it needs not much be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that their poſſeſſing of the gate of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type of what the ſpirituall ſeed ſhould doe, as to the enemies gate, in the times of the New Teſtament. But becauſe to ſome it may be it will be yet a queſtion, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what is ſaid of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 9. 26. Where the Lord giveth a promiſe to <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Japheth,</hi> to the ſelfe ſame purpoſe, and of the ſame tenour as here in theſe two places, he doth to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>ſhall be his ſervant; God ſhall enlarge, or perſwade,</hi> Japheth, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the tents of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>ſhall be his ſervant.</hi> As for his being a ſervant unto Shem, that was fulfilled in the conqueſt of the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> by <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, who were <hi>Shems</hi> poſterity; but for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118924:31"/> his being a ſervant to <hi>Iapheth,</hi> dwelling in the tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> that is to be fulfilled in the times of the New Teſtament, when <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> make one Church, one ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 16. Rom. 4. 16.</note> That I think will be granted to be the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>God ſhall enlarge</hi> Japheth, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the tents of</hi> Shem. And upon the ſame account as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi> are put for the Church of the New Teſtament, wherein none can with any certainty affirm which is <hi>Japheths</hi> poſterity in nature, and which is <hi>Shems; Canaan</hi> is there put for the wicked of the world, whether of his poſterity or not. And as <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Japheth,</hi> are there made types of the one, ſo alſo is <hi>Canaan</hi> of the other; and the meaning this, that in the times of the New Teſtament, there will be a ſeaſon wherein the wicked of the world ſhall be under the Church of God. Therefore here when God comes to renew the ſame promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> with an addition touching the manner how it ſhould be accompliſhed, namely, by his <hi>bleſſing and multiplying his ſeed,</hi> he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the ſame phraſe, and ſaith, <hi>To thee and to thy ſeed will I give all the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the gate of his enemies:</hi> The meaning therefore muſt be the ſame, namely, that he and his ſeed ſhould be heirs of the world; and that his ſeed ſhould fill the world at laſt, and rule over it, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>For a further clearing hereof, conſider how the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe laſt times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that promiſe, <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhall be his ſervant, ſhall bee fulfilled, ſaith, <hi>In that day there ſhall be no more the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite <hi>in the houſe of the Lord of Hoſts, Zach.</hi> 14. 21. where by <hi>Canaanite</hi> is meant a wicked man, or a man of the world; according to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118924:32"/> place parallel to this in <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame times and things. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it,</hi> that is, the Church or Houſe of God, <hi>any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a lye; but they which are written in the Lambs Book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a further illuſtration of this matter, it is conſiderable, what one very probably obſerveth concerning that of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14. how, in reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lot,</hi> he overcame thoſe four Kings, whoſe people afterwards became the four Monarchyes, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſet forth by <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed at laſt ſhall break in pieces, and obtain their power. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>Amraphel King of Shinar,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Babylonian Monarchy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Arioch King of Ellaſar</hi> the Grecian, for <hi>Hellas</hi> is the name of <hi>Greece,</hi>

               <p>Thus we ſee in theſe foure things, what that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is which God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him to all beleevers, as his ſeed; and what particulars are contained in it.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118924:32"/> to contain the whole Goſpel; which Goſpel we ſee doth not only bring us the glad tidings of remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſalvation by Chriſt; but alſo concerning the Saints being put into a Kingdome, as alſo the increaſe and power which that Kingdome ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and by what means it ſhall be made ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; for which cauſe alſo it is called <hi>the Goſpel of the Kingdome;</hi> and <hi>godlineſs</hi> is ſaid to <hi>have promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1.</label> Why the Lord ſhould take this courſe in bleſſing of his people? Evident it is that he was reſolved to bleſſe them as his Children, with all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings in Chriſt; but why ſhould he do it in ſuch a method, to ſingle out one of his people, namely <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to bleſſe him as the originall pattern, and in him to bleſſe all the reſt as his ſeed? For ſo the point is, <hi>that what God confirmed by oath to</hi> Abraham, <hi>he confirmed it to us, even to all beleevers to the Worlds end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> The reaſon of it is in the Text. Namely, <hi>that he might ſhew the immutability of his counſel to the Heirs of promiſe,</hi> and that he might doe as much as might be to help and ſtrengthen his peoples faith, that they might the better truſt him. The Lord knew that by drawing out his work into length of time, as he hath done, and laying his deſignes ſo long before, he ſhould have occaſion to do the ſame things over againe and againe, and therefore ſhould in his works to former of his Saints, give types and ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118924:33"/> of what his people might expect in after times, even in that great work, the conqueſt of the world by the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. As for inſtance, what he did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the fleſh, in their deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> driving out the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the affairs of his Kingdome among that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that Land, he doth over again, though in a more ſpiritual way, for his people under the Goſpel which are <hi>the Iſrael of God,</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo. <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 29. &amp; 6. 16. Heb. 8. 8.</note> And their condition made parallel with ours by the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. to 11. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. as hath been ſhewed. Now this advantage to his peoples faith, God would not loſe; therefore he giveth not only his promiſe and oath, but alſo gives them firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him to all his Saints in aftertimes; that ſo they might have their eyes and obſervation fixt upon all his works wrought for his people in ages before, in anſwer to the ſelfe ſame promiſes to be beleeved by them. And in this the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe have a double advantage to their faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the immutability of the counſel of God is aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by way of experience, in as much as they are required to believe no more then what they ſee others have beleeved, and hath been fulfilled to them long before, and beleeved it upon the ſame terms, our caſe being made by this his bleſſing of his people in this method the ſame with theirs. This therefore was <hi>Davids</hi> argument for comfort in his deſertions; nay of Chriſt himſelfe, of whom even in that very thing <hi>David</hi> was a type. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted and thou dideſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, they cryed unto thee and were delivered, they truſted in thee and were not confounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:118924:33"/>
               <p>Secondly, in that it was the ſureſt and cleareſt way, of making known the mind of God unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thus by taking one of the ſame kind, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him a pattern for all the reſt. He might have done it by large deſcriptions in words, but ſo had we been more entangled with variety of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it being to paſs through many ages, languages, and nations; whereas by taking ſuch a pattern to hold forth to all ages, what his people may expect from him, our underſtandings are fixed more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things then words, whereby we have a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, and leſſe ſubject to miſtakes. Thus the great priviledge and power of the Saints, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the enemies of thoſe whom God will thus bleſſe, by overcoming God himſelfe by prayer, was firſt given to <hi>Jacob, (Gen.</hi> 32.) with his new Name, and in him to all the reſt of his people, and for the ſelfe ſame cauſe.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</label> Why the Lord, who beſtoweth his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings according to his own free election, ſhould ſo confine his choice, as to beſtow theſe bleſſings by families, and by nations, that he taketh not his number proportionally from all places of the world alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Many reaſons may be given of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not impertinent to be conſidered, that his purpoſe is to raiſe up an abundant glory to himſelf from ſmall things; that is one reaſon why he choſe men, and among men <hi>not many mighty, but the weak things of this world are choſen:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> therefore would he not leave little Children out of his Kingdome. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) that is, they alſo are part of it. By ſuch he meaneth not as ſo qualified, but that of ſuch alſo the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118924:34"/> Kingdome doth conſiſt; Both becauſe it is by him given as an argument or reaſon why children ſhould be brought to him; for had he intended the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation only, it had been an argument as well to bring Lambs or Doves to Chriſt, for ſo are the ſubjects of his Kingdome qualified, even as Lambs and Doves. And becauſe he ſaith afterwards, <hi>whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdome of God as a little Child,</hi> that is, as a child receiveth it, <hi>ſhall not enter therein;</hi> This our Saviour addeth to ſhew the miſtake of his Diſciples, who thought, it ſeems, that little children were not capable of receiving the Kingdome of God, or of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into it, or to be made partakers of the bleſſings of Chriſt, and therefore did forbid their being brought to him; to which he ſaith, that they are as capable of that work upon their ſoules as others are, in as much as, in the firſt reception of the Kingdome of God into our ſoules, we are as little Children are, that is, we are meerly paſſive in it. Now becauſe he would that little children alſo ſhould be members of his Kingdome, therefore hath he made it one branch of the Goſpel of this Kingdome, <hi>that the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the righteous ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is it to be omitted, that by this means is made to appear that in Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſame is done to life, as was in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> unto death. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, ſo in Christ ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. Now if you conſider what makes us children of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> you will find that the originall of our Sonſhip in Chriſt is Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, having predeſtinated us to the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By a natural birth we cannot be made ſonnes in Chriſt, for our ſonſhip is founded in grace;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118924:34"/> therefore (I ſay) it hath its originall from Gods free election, who <hi>will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 15.</note> Now therefore ſince this cannot be by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, and it muſt be acknowledged that the children of beleevers are by <hi>nature born children of wrath even as others,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 52. 5.</note> the Lord yet goes as far as may be, and by promiſe hath ſo confined his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ordinarily to caſt elect children upon elect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which is more clear, the reaſon is, becauſe of his love to elect parents. The Lord knows what it is for Parents to be bleſſed in their Children, and how he indeareth himſelf to his Saints thereby. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 37. <hi>Becauſe he loved thy fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 15. to 21. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel, they are enemies for your ſakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe of his love to his elect when children; therefore he caſteth them upon ſuch Parents, by whom they may be brought up in his fear, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had not been; and he loves to work as much as may be by ſecond cauſes. Where could <hi>Iſaac</hi> have been ſo brought up as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family? <hi>I know</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham (ſaith God) <hi>that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord. Gen.</hi> 18. 19. Had not the Lord thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined his choice (for an abſolute confinement there is not, as was ſhewed before) to Families, Kindreds, and Nations, his elect had been deſtitute of means of Education: and the great advantage in the family relation, for the ſeaſoning of the hearts of young ones with his fear, had been loſt; which advantage God would not loſe; therefore in all the ages of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118924:35"/> world, his bleſſing ſtill hath been upon the families of his people. Untill he put his Church into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome every believers family was a Church, as the Church is yet called <hi>the houſhold of God;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 19. &amp; 3. 15.</note> His bleſſing therefore was upon them for that ſeaſon upon that account. And as in <hi>Abraham</hi> he laid the foundation of that Kingdom, ſo in him he begins that promiſe of a bleſſing upon beleevers families, that when his Church ſhould conſiſt of many families put together, yet each might have his bleſſing ſtill upon it.</p>
               <p n="5">Fifthly, This he doth becauſe it is the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and readieſt way to multiply the ſpirituall ſeed, for the increaſe of that his Kingdom; which as in <hi>Abraham</hi> he began, ſo in this promiſe, firſt given to him, of a bleſſing upon Families and Nations, by making him &amp; all beleevers bleſſings, he laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the greatneſſe of it. This is that which maketh this Kingdom to be like leaven, (as was ſhewed) whereby although at firſt it was but little, yet at laſt it ſhall leaven the whole lump. By his making believers bleſſings, they are the means whereby perſons are ſeaſoned with the knowledge and love of Chriſt, eſpecially the young ones brought up under their tuition. Should he have taken his elect from all places of the world alike, then it may be here had been three or four in <hi>England,</hi> as many in <hi>France,</hi> and ſo of the reſt: the Turks, Perſians, Indians, all other Nations, muſt each have had their proportion; ſo as the Saints muſt have lived each one alone by themſelves, and in an ordinary way could not have been built up, nor the Kingdom of Chriſt increaſed. But when God caſteth the lot of his Saints together, making his choice by Families, Kindreds, and Nations; by this means the gifts of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118924:35"/> Gods people are improved, and light increaſed; one beleever receiveth help, and taketh light from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſucceeding generation from the former, and each generation is exceeded by that which commeth after: becauſe the children ſtand as it were upon their fathers ſhoulders, and in many things ſee that which they ſaw not, untill at laſt <hi>the earth be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 11. 9.</note> and the whole world be ſubdued to the power of the Goſpel, the Sword and Scepter of his Kingdom. And I muſt adde, that this is one great deſigne of God, in the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to bring down the knowledge of himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt ſo far to our capacity, as that by the uſe of ordinary means and gifts, in ſtudying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 4. Joh. 16. 13, 14. Heb. 1. 1.</note> his people may ſearch into and underſtand the deep things of God, ſo as not to need the help of extraordinary gifts, ſuch as the Prophets had under the Old Teſtament, which then in the nonage of the Church were of uſe and neceſſary. Now had not he taken this courſe in his election, he had been croſſed utterly in this his purpoſe; becauſe had he not ſo provided for the education, increaſe, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his people, it muſt have been by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary waies and gifts, or not at all.</p>

And becauſe, as he will himſelfe be <hi>righteous in all his works,</hi> and the Kingdome of Chriſt muſt be a righteous Kingdom, (Pſal. 45. <hi>The Scepter of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a right ſcepter</hi>) ſo the affairs of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be managed, and the increaſe thereof endeavoured by his people, by ſuch means and waies as are according to common rules of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and juſtice among men; Which could not be, ſhould it by violence only be effected. <hi>God hath given the earth to the children of men,</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> It will be ſaid, it may be, that when the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the promiſed Land were deſtroyed by the Church of God, his people did not act therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common rules of righteouſneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, in as much as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no ſuch title in nature or reaſon to that Land.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> That what the Iſraelites did in this was by ſpeciall revelation and command from God, who, when he would make a Nationall Church, and ſo the Land poſſeſſed by his people an holy land, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when the iniquity of the old inhabitants was full, did by his prerogative inſtitution execrate or anathematize them, devoting them unto deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: which ſentence as he might juſtly paſſe upon them for their ſinnes, ſo his people alſo might as juſtly execute at his command. But there is no ſuch revelations, nor commands, nor ſuch adminiſtrations to be expected now, in the times of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, though it be a truth, that even in theſe times alſo there are execrable things, which by vertue of his inſtitution are to be rooted out of the Church, whereof that conqueſt of that <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type. And if we ſeek out the anſwer-type, or what among his people now may hold parallel with that action, we ſhall not finde it in an earthly, but in an heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor in a caſting of wicked perſons out of a nation, or out of the world, but out of the Church
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118924:37"/> by excommunication. Nor may any thing at all be done by the Church, as ſuch, but what is ſpiritua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore I ſay, that in a way of righteouſneſſe his people may obtain the poſſeſſion of the gate of their enemies, One courſe which God taketh to fulfil this his promiſe, is by multiplying them. As by bleſſing he will multiply the ſeed, ſo by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them he will cauſe them to poſſeſſe the gate of their enemies. And by this means that dominion and power which they ſhall at laſt obtain, ſhall need no force, either to get, or to maintain it, but it ſhall naturally fall upon them as from other cauſes ſo alſo by reaſon of their number, even according to the law of nature, and common rules of righteouſneſſe and juſtice. Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 2. 3. that <hi>in the laſt days, when the mountain of the Lords Houſe,</hi> that is, the Church <hi>ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and exalted above the hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it;</hi> and when Chriſt <hi>ſhall judge among the Nations; that they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpeares into pruning hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What courſe the Lord will take alſo to leſſen the number of the wicked before that day come, I ſhall not now diſcuſſe, although the Scripture is not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in it; but what by deſtroying the one, and what by multiplying the other, the number of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> will in time be ſuch, as that in a way of righteouſneſſe, and juſtice, the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118924:37"/> the enemies gate will be theirs. Therefore I ſay, God hath need of ſuch a number for a fulfilling of his promiſe. And this is one reaſon why he ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly multiplies the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is of this world, is fading, and hath a period ſet for its continuance; but the Kingdome of Chriſt is everlaſting. <hi>Thy throne O God is for ever and ever.</hi> Pſal. 45. 6. Therefore when it is ſaid, That <hi>the Dominion and the Kingdome under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt High:</hi> and the <hi>Kingdomes of the earth become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt:</hi> the meaning is, not that the Kingdome of Chriſt ſhall then be of this World, or ſhall ceaſe to be a ſpiritual Kingdome, or that the Kingdomes of the world ſhall ceaſe to be of this world; that is, the one ſhall not ceaſe to conſiſt of that which is natural, both for the Matter, Order, Power, and End of the Kingdome; nor the other ceaſe to conſiſt of that which is ſpiritual, and heavenly; for that were for it to degenerate, and to be depoſed from its glory; But as a man, when he is made a ſubject of Jeſus Chriſt in his converſion, is made a ſpirituall man, <hi>a new creature,</hi> not but that he is the ſame man in nature ſtill, but ſuch a work is wrought in him as he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalently another man, yea as much another in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as if he had been annihilated, and a new man made out of the duſt; for, though he be the ſame man in nature ſtill, yet by Union and Communion with Chriſt, he is acted by another principle of life to what he was before, namely, by the <hi>quickening ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Adam:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> ſo that whereas before, he was onely of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> now he is of the <hi>ſecond;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was only <hi>of the earth earthy,</hi> now he is alſo <hi>of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118924:38"/> Lord from Heaven;</hi> So when <hi>the Kingdomes of the earth are become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> they will be the ſame Kingdoms in nature ſtill, and the ſame things done, and upon the ſame grounds of common juſtice; yet becauſe the people of God will be ſo multiplied, as theirs will be the power, it will be equivalent to ſuch a change as if they did ceaſe to be the Kingdomes of the earth, and were turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Chriſt. The Kingdomes of Chriſt, and of the world, will ever be diſtinct in their Nature, and Uſe; yet ſuch influence will the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt have upon Commonwealths, as they will be, as it were, ſwallowed up into it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as our Saviour alledged that unto the Roman Governour, when he was accuſed for an enemy to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and for which it is evident, he put him to death, becauſe <hi>he made himſelf a King,</hi> alledged I ſay for his defence, that <hi>his Kingdome was not of this World,</hi> and therefore would be no interruption unto <hi>Ceſars:</hi> ſo may it be alledged ſtill, againſt the jealouſies and hard thoughts which men are apt to have of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, becauſe of this Doctrine, that the time will come when the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall poſſeſs the gate of their enemies; I ſay it may be alledged that <hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this World,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no cauſe of any jealous thoughts, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be any diſturbance to the Kingdomes of this World. Juſtice, and righteouſneſſe, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Magiſtrates, will have their free courſe, and upon grounds of nature and reaſon as before: And what influence the Kingdome or Subjects of Chriſt ſhall have upon the Kingdomes of the World, will not be deſtructive to them, but perfective of them. That which is ſpiritual deſtroyeth not that which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118924:39"/> natural, but perfects it. The power will be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devolved upon them, as from other cauſes, ſo alſo becauſe of their number, and having power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in their hands, they ſhall do the ſame things for which government is ordained, and upon the ſame grounds in nature as before; onely here will be the difference, what they do, they will do it like Saints, and as becomes thoſe who are ſubjects of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and as in obedience unto his command. As a beleever does all the ſame duties in nature, in all relations in the world, Parents to Children, Maſters to Servants, Children to Parents, Servants to Maſters, one Neighbour to another, as he did before his converſion, or as other men doe, only with this difference: unregenerate perſons do them onely upon a natural ground; and becauſe nature is corrupt, the duties many times are done accordingly; but a beleever, though he doth the ſame things, and upon the ſame natural ground too, yet he doth them alſo in obedience unto Chriſt, and as ſent by him about that work: in which reſpect his people are ſaid to be ſent by him into the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>The Servant is not greater then his Lord, neither he that is ſent greater then he that ſent him.</hi> In our converſion he taketh us out of this world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Becauſe ye are not of the world, but</hi> I <hi>have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> And he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us into the world againe, becauſe there lies our work, and the ſame duties in nature we are to doe, yet not as being of the world, but as being of Chriſt, and <hi>called out of the world,</hi> and <hi>ſent in againe</hi> by him: Thus, when the men of this world are in place of government, they act onely upon principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the nature of man being by ſin corrupted,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118924:39"/> the work is done accordingly; hence is all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in the world, even from thoſe whoſe work and intereſt it is to preſerve juſtice what they can. But when this power is caſt upon the people of the Lord, though they ſhall performe the ſame work of righteouſneſſe in government, and upon the ſame ground in nature too, yet they ſhall act as perſons who have more then nature in them; namely as ſuch who are ſent by Chriſt, and governed by his word and ſpirit; So as the inhabitants of the earth ſhall have no cauſe to complain, that power is put into ſuch hands; nay they ſhall greatly rejoyce in that day, as is foretold often by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 97. 1. <hi>The Lord raigneth, let the earth rejoyce; O clap your hands all ye people, ſhout unto God with the voice of triumph, for the Lord moſt high is terrible, he is a great King over all the earth. Pſal.</hi> 47. 1.</p>

                  <p>Which being ſo, now for our purpoſe, let it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be conſidered that as God made an addition to his Goſpel, or rather a further diſcovery of his mind therein, in his promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo he alſo made an <hi>addition to the ſeals,</hi> for confirmation of it to his people, namely, <hi>the ſeal of Circumciſion,</hi> which alſo was firſt given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not in uſe before.</p>
                  <p>And as this addition to his Goſpel was a promiſe of making beleevers <hi>bleſſings to families, and nations,</hi> in order to the <hi>multiplying of the ſeed,</hi> and encreaſe of the Kingdome of Chriſt, ſo the application of this ſeale to Infants, is <hi>part of the ſeale,</hi> thereby ſignifying and confirming that promiſe of ſuch <hi>bleſſing.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>This is my covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee; every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed; and the uncircumciſed man-child, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my covenant.</hi> Had not the application of it to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant been <hi>part of the token of the covenant,</hi> the childs not being circumciſed had not been a breach of the covenant; nor could the Lord have ſaid, <hi>this is my covenant, that the man-child be circumciſed,</hi> if the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that ordinance to the child had not in it a ſignification and confirmation of ſome thing in the covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thence alſo is that in <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>He gave</hi> Abraham <hi>the covenant of circumciſion, and ſo</hi> (or accordingly) <hi>he begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and circumciſed him the eighth day.</hi> That
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118924:41"/> is, he did it according to that covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo as the application of the ſeale to the Infant was part of the covenant to be performed on the part of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his ſeed in their generations,</hi> even by his ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>to a thouſand generations,</hi> in that which is the ſame for ſubſtance, and equivalent to circumciſion, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
                  <p>And that this bleſſing upon families and poſterity, was ſignified, held forth, and ſealed by circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the child, appeareth further, by that promiſe uttered in that phraſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed,</hi> which kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion intimates, that the promiſe of the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their children was held forth, and confirmed in that ſeale. As when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one body,</hi> it implyeth, that our union with Chriſt in one body, is ſignified &amp; ſealed in baptiſme; becauſe elſe, thoſe words had been in no capacity to have been ſo uſed in that ſenſe as they are uſed, both by the Apoſtle and by <hi>Moſes.</hi> But in ſtead of ſaying <hi>we are baptized into Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtle muſt have uſed ſome ſuch words, We are united or ingraffed into Chriſt: And <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt have ſaid, that God would convert their ſeed, or he would change their hearts, not that he would <hi>circumciſe their hearts;</hi> for what had the converſion of their ſeed been to circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or union with Chriſt to baptiſme, had not the one been ſignified by the one, and the other by the other?</p>
                  <p>Moreover I may adde, that the ſigne had not held proportion with the thing ſignified; namely, there had been nothing in the ſigne to ſignifie and ſeal that bleſſing upon poſterity, had the application of it to Infants been left out; which I the rather urge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118924:41"/> this bleſſing upon families, in order to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of the ſpiritual ſeed, is that peculiar additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made in Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to what he had given before to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Wife, which therefore in the ſeal thereof ſhould not be omitted. Nor indeed had there been any uſe of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the infant, nor that made a part of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, had there not been ſuch a branch in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as a bleſſing upon families and poſterity to be thereby ſignified and ſealed.</p>
                  <p>By that which hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe, is evident that as <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant was ſealed in circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo this additional promiſe in it of multiplying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, by making them bleſſings unto families, and nations, was ſignified and ſealed, by the application of the ſeal to Infants; ſo as if that priviledge be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied unto Infants, that which was given to us in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> covenant is rejected, as he ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>The uncircumciſed man-child ſhall be cut off from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hath broken my covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is further to be obſerved, that in reference to theſe two things; namely, this <hi>additional promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſeale</hi> thereof (in reſpect of which things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant exceeds that promiſe given to our firſt Parents) was he called the father of all them that beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, (I ſay) from this additionall promiſe is he ſo called, as appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Who againſt hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations, according to that which was ſpoken, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be, that is, as the Stars of Heaven for multitude. Gen.</hi> 15. 5. It was not onely his beleeving in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but his receiving, and beleeving that promiſe concerning the Lords thus <hi>multiplying his ſeed,</hi> that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118924:42"/> made him <hi>the father of many nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was not onely that which made him ſo, but alſo his receiving the ſeale of that promiſe, as we ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>He received the ſigne of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that beleeve, though they be not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo.</hi> From which place we may obſerve, Firſt, that circumciſion was a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith. Secondly, that becauſe it was a ſeale of that righteouſneſſe, which he had before he was circumciſed, he therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Father of all that beleeve, whether circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed or not. Now had not this ſeal been given him that he might be the Father of beleevers, his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it at this or that time, whether before, or after his beleeving to righteouſneſſe, had made nothing for the univerſality of his relation as a <hi>Father of all Beleevers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was not his faith onely, nor his degree of faith above others which gave him that title appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, becauſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſo ſhould <hi>Eve</hi> rather be called the mother of the faithfull, or <hi>Adam</hi> the father of them, becauſe they were the firſt beleevers, and in likelihood their faith not much if at all inferiour unto <hi>Abrahams.</hi> And &amp; <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> others are likely to have had as ſtrong a faith as his. Nor do we find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where all are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is preferred before theirs. One great advantage, which is a longer experience of God, theirs had above his. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. we find, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was above <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> in one thing, ſo he above <hi>Abraham</hi> in another. <hi>He bleſſed Abraham,</hi> and (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>without controverſy, the leſſer is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118924:42"/> bleſſed of the greater.</hi> V. 7. And that wherein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had preheminence, is not ſpecifyed to be his faith, but that he had <hi>received the promiſes,</hi> V. 6. <hi>he bleſſed him that had the promiſes,</hi> all which <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek</hi> had not received, namely, ſuch promiſes as were peculiar to <hi>Abraham, as the father of Beleevers:</hi> as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes of life and ſalvation by Chriſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed, <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> had received them as well as <hi>Abraham.</hi> In this I ſay was <hi>Abraham</hi> preferred, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by office <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> was greater then he. Therefore ſince there were beleevers, and eminent beleevers before him, he could not be the father of the faithfull either becauſe of his faith, or the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, beſides this, when God gave him his new name, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and made him the <hi>father of the faithfull,</hi> he gave him ſomething new, which was not, at leaſt not ſo held forth unto beleevers in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. As when <hi>Peter</hi> had his new name and the <hi>keys of the Kingdom</hi> given him, it was a new gift. For albeit there was ſomething of that nature before, at leaſt in ſubſtance, in the Iewiſh Church, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the ſame. So when to <hi>Iacob</hi> was given a new name, with a promiſe of overcoming the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>the holy ſeed,</hi> or of this <hi>kingdome</hi> by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming God in <hi>prayer,</hi> it was a new promiſe; for the Church till then had not ſuch occaſions of enemies to riſe up againſt it, as now it had, when God would ſingle out a people, rejecting ſome, and chuſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that in ſuch an externall and eminent way, to be a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdome for himſelf.</hi> Now ſhould the Saints be hard put to it, to do much that way in prayer. This people and kingdome he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118924:43"/> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as hath been ſhewed; and although it is true <hi>Eſau</hi> was not the firſt enemy againſt this Kingdome, or ſeed; <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was before him; yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt who in that manner oppoſed it, as to ſeek to deſtroy the ſeed. As for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, <hi>ſcorned</hi> Iſaac <hi>and mocked him;</hi> ſo did <hi>Eſau</hi> ſlight it at the firſt, when he ſold his birthright; but at laſt he found himſelfe pinched and aggrieved ſo as he ſought to deſtroy <hi>Jacob.</hi> Enemies of God at firſt uſe to ſlight, and ſcorne, that which afterwards they perſecute even to blood; thus did <hi>Eſau.</hi> Therefore (I ſay) <hi>Jacob</hi> was the <hi>firſt,</hi> who was put to it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Heaven, to prevaile againſt the enemies of this Kingdome, and had his name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> given him thereupon. <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> And the <hi>peace of the Iſrael of God</hi> depends upon ſuch a conqueſt at this day. Thus in <hi>Abrahams</hi> new name, and his being made <hi>the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> there was ſomething given which beleevers had not, at leaſt in ſuch a way had not before, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to which he was ſo called. Therefore it was not for his faith only, nor the eminency thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is nothing in faith, or in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency thereof, that could occaſion that his name to be given unto him.</p>
                  <p>When God gave <hi>Jacob</hi> his name <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was a name ſutable to his prevailing with God, it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much. So the name <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Stone,</hi> which was given to <hi>Simon,</hi> and in him to us, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that confeſſion of Chriſt, which maketh us <hi>Stones</hi> in his Temple. So when God gave <hi>Abram</hi> his name <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was upon a like account. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Father of multitudes,</hi> and that reaſon of it is expreſly rendred by the Lord himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5. Thy name ſhall be <hi>Abraham, for a Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118924:43"/> have I made thee.</hi> In the New Teſtament called <hi>the father of all them that beleeve.</hi> And it pointeth us to this, that it was in reference to ſomething which he was to have as <hi>a Father,</hi> for which he was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, namely, this additional promiſe made to him in his covenant, and the ſeale thereof, concerning the multiplying of his ſeed, by making him and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers after him, to be bleſſings to <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> and was therefore ſo called, both becauſe he was the firſt <hi>Father</hi> that received this bleſſing, which was a bleſſing upon parents &amp; their children; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, at leaſt in a great part, by vertue thereof the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed was to be propagated and encreaſed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are ſaid to be his <hi>ſeed,</hi> becauſe that promiſe &amp; covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the Lords <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and multiplying his ſeed,</hi> is ſo much a cauſe of their being brought forth unto Chriſt; his ordering his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſo, as to beſtow his bleſſing thus by <hi>Families and Nations,</hi> being that which makes the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven like leaven,</hi> as was ſhewed before, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, ordinarily, being the meanes of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another.</p>
                  <p>Some think beleevers are called the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> becauſe they are propagated from his example in beleeving, becauſe they are ſaid to <hi>walk in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham.</hi> But this is not a ſufficient reaſon for that denomination; <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 12.</note> for we are to look as well at the example of others <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. There is mention of a <hi>cloud of witneſses, compaſſing us about,</hi> to whoſe examples we are to look; chiefly to look at <hi>Chriſt, the Authour, or the Captain,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi> had his new name, and is called the <hi>Father of all them that beleeve,</hi> in reference
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118924:44"/> to theſe two things; Firſt, becauſe of this additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſe given in order to the encreaſe of his ſpiritual ſeed; and Secondly, becauſe he had given him alſo the ſeale of this promiſe, the circumciſion of the child.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of what we have in this firſt uſe, for clearing the duty of Infant-Baptiſme, is this; That from the conſideration of the difference, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of theſe two great promiſes, that to our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> and this to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we take occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe five things. Firſt, that in this promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> an addition was made to the former promiſe. Secondly, that the Lord upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion added a <hi>ſeale</hi> alſo, for confirmation of his Goſpel to his people; namely, the <hi>ſign of circumciſion,</hi> the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant. Thirdly, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the token unto Infants, was part of the token of the covenant. Fourthly, that as this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſe was of a <hi>bleſſing upon families, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> in order to <hi>multiply the ſeed,</hi> ſo by this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the token unto Infants was this promiſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Fifthly, that in reference to this additionall promiſe, and the ſeale thereof, was <hi>Abraham</hi> called <hi>the Father of all them that beleeve,</hi> and they his ſeed: So as what he received from the Lord, both in the promiſe, and the ſeale thereof, he received it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelfe, but alſo for his ſeed, even his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeed in their generations.</p>

                  <p>From thence to learne, not to confine that great promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. within the compaſſe of an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> as meant onely of the temporal things of that Land, or the multiplying of his natural ſeed therein; but alſo of all ſuch bleſſings in Chriſt, whereof <hi>Canaan</hi> and the good things thereof were types.

                  <p>If any ſhall affirm, that in neither of theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects that promiſe can be brought down to theſe times, it behooveth ſuch to find out ſome other ſenſe, wherein it may be ſo extended, becauſe we ſee that <hi>what the Lord confirmed unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>of bleſſing, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying, and cauſing his ſeed to poſſeſs the gate of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he confirmed it to us, even to beleevers of the New Teſtament, as his ſeed and heirs according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In opening the point, I was the larger in the proofe hereof, and have therefore inſiſted upon ſome things by the by, concerning the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118924:45"/> (although a full unfolding thereof would require a farre larger diſcourſe) becauſe it conduceth much towards the clearing of Infant-Baptiſme to be a duty which God requireth of his people, that the full extent of Gods promiſe unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> whereof we have found that to be one branch, be conſidered and underſtood.</p>
                  <p>For if this be granted, that the promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi> 17. eſpecially that part of it, v. 8. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Canaan</hi> to be an everlaſting poſſeſſion to his ſeed, be of ſuch extent, and made alſo to his ſpiritual ſeed of the New Teſtament, it will follow, that that command of God in thoſe words next following, verſ. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou and thy ſeed after thee, in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> is to be meant alſo of his <hi>ſpirituall ſeed</hi> even in our dayes, and as a command that now lieth upon the ſame <hi>ſpiritual ſeed, in all Generations,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Obj.</label> It will be ſaid, how is this command of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this covenant obliging to beleevers now, ſince the covenant to be kept was then ſpecified to be the circumciſing of the child, in as much as circumciſion is now aboliſhed? Or what is this to baptizing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118924:46"/> children, the point in hand to be cleared in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, It is to be obſerved, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God is primarily fixed upon the generall duty, namely, <hi>the covenant to be kept,</hi> and not upon this or that way of keeping, either by circumciſing, or baptiſing: ſo as the circumciſing of the Childe came under the command onely upon this, becauſe it was declared then to be the token of the covenant; and by the words it is ſuppoſed, that when it ſhould ceaſe to be the token of the covenant, it ſhould no longer be a duty; and what elſe, by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhould be made the token of the ſame covenant, would be the duty in ſtead thereof. Mark the words, he doth not ſay, Thou ſhalt therfore circumciſe every man-child among you, as a token of the covenant between me and you; for ſo had that been made the token for perpetuity, to have continued ſo long as the covenant it ſelfe. But firſt, in general he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy ſeed after thee, in their Generations;</hi> that is, they ſhould obſerve and performe the token of the covenant, whatever that prove to be; and in the ſecond place, he addeth, <hi>This is my covenant which ye ſhall keep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and you, and thy ſeed after thee; every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child among you ſhall be circumciſed, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed man-child hath broken my covenant:</hi> therefore, as I ſaid, as for circumciſion, that was a duty onely upon thoſe words, declaring that to be then the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Circumciſion is now aboliſhed, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of keeping the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant is ſtill in force, and binding to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed, in their Generations; therefore what is now the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118924:46"/> of that covenant muſt be obſerved in ſtead thereof.</p>
                  <p>The like manner of inſtitution we have concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> therefore thoſe who deny Infant-Baptiſm, oftentimes deny the Sabbath, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, for there is the ſame reaſon of both, and we may illuſtrate the one by the other. The Lord intended in time to change the day, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week, as he intended in time to change the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant; therefore in the fourth Commandement alſo, the command is not primarily fixed upon the ſeventh, or any day, to be remembred and kept holy, but upon the general duty, that the reſt-day of the Lord be remembred, and kept holy, what ever that day fall to be. <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 8. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day,</hi> that is, <hi>the reſt-day, to keep it holy; and the Lord bleſſed the reſt-day, and ſanctified it.</hi> And the remembrance and keeping of the ſeventh day is in the commandement made a duty for this reaſon, becauſe that was declared to be then the day, wherein <hi>God had entred into his reſt,</hi> after his making of the world. And upon the ſame account, when after the travaile of his ſoule, in the new creation, he entred the <hi>ſecond time into his reſt,</hi> as it is declared that he did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. 10. (as was ſhewed p. 11. 12. as alſo appeareth by what he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 28. that he is <hi>Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> which he could not be, unleſſe he alſo had a <hi>reſt</hi> which he <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, as God did into his.</hi>) Becauſe that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt day of the week, when he roſe from the dead; therefore by vertue of that command, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the reſt-day to keep it holy, the firſt day of the week is now to be remembred and kept holy, in as much as that is now the reſt-day of the Lord
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118924:47"/> our God, as formerly the ſeventh day was.</p>
                  <p>As for his <hi>Aſcention,</hi> I confeſſe, it is not ſo clear, although very probable, to be upon that day, from <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Acts 1. 3. 12.</note> by the computation of the <hi>forty days</hi> from his Reſurrection, and the mention of <hi>a Sabbath dayes journey,</hi> from mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> occaſioned (as is likely) from their making that journey then upon that <hi>day,</hi> verſ. 12. But albeit his reſt was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated till he paſſed into the Heavens, and ſat down on the right hand of the majeſty on high, yet he firſt entred into it at his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> in as much as he was <hi>raiſed in incorruption, with a ſpiritual body, and in glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. 43. 49. 20. And becauſe he did then firſt ceaſe from the <hi>travaile of his ſoul:</hi> Which (I ſay) being upon the firſt day of the week, there needeth no more to fix that command upon this day, as a day which God hath <hi>ſanctified and bleſſed;</hi> becauſe it comes within the general rule preſcribed, that the <hi>reſt-day of the Lord muſt be remembred, and kept holy, and that the Lord bleſſed the reſt-day and ſanctified it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as if we ſhould <hi>analyſe</hi> that fourth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may take it thus.</p>
                  <p>In that commandement we have
<list>
                        <item>1. A duty commanded, namely, that <hi>the Lords reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> that is, the day wherein he entred into his reſt, be <hi>remembred,</hi> that is, that the memorial of it be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, and that by <hi>keeping of it holy.</hi> In that ſenſe the word <hi>remember</hi> is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 3, 4. to 9. <hi>Remember this day in which ye came out of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Heſter</hi> 9. 27. 28. <hi>The</hi> Jewes <hi>ordained, and took upon them, and their ſeed, and upon all that joyned themſelves unto them, that they would keep theſe two days, according to their writing, every year; and that theſe dayes ſhould be remembred, and kept, and that theſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118924:47"/> days of Purim ſhould not faile from among the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor the memorial of them periſh from their ſeed.</hi> So the Lord here commands <hi>the memorial of his reſt-day</hi> to be preſerved, by <hi>keeping that day holy.</hi>

                                    <item>1. Becauſe <hi>God made the world in ſix days, and reſted the ſeventh.</hi>

                                    <item>2. Becauſe <hi>he therefore bleſſed the reſt-day, and ſanctified it, becauſe therein he had reſted.</hi>
                                    </item>
                                 </list>

                        </item>
                     </list> So as by this analyſis, we ſee that the ſeventh day was commanded to be kept in this manner, not as the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> but as the <hi>reſt day of the Lord;</hi> for that we ſee is the reaſon of the duty, becauſe <hi>God had reſted therein,</hi> and becauſe <hi>he therefore bleſſed and ſanctified the reſt-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been the longer upon this point concerning the Sabbath, becauſe it receives ſo much a like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world with this of Infant-Baptiſme, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118924:48"/> the clearing of the one will help us in the other. For in like manner alſo, in this of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant there is
<list>
                        <item>1. A duty commanded, <hi>viz. to keep that covenant, viz.</hi> the <hi>token, ſign, or ſeal</hi> thereof, which is a part of it, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were and are to keep.</item>
                        <item>2. A declaration, or explication, what was then the token of it, namely, <hi>that the man-child be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed;</hi> and in caſe <hi>the Child was not circumciſed,</hi> that <hi>the covenant was broken.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all which we ſee, that notwithſtanding the token of the covenant was ſpecified then to be the <hi>circumciſing of the child,</hi> which is now aboliſhed: Yet the command of keeping the covenant, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that which is the token of it, is ſtill in force, and lieth on the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even his ſpirituall ſeed, to this day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For anſwer further, it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>baptiſme</hi> is now in the roome of <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> and is the very ſame, for ſubſtance, to us, as <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> was to them before Chriſt, namely, the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſeale of that covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>his ſeed,</hi> as appeareth, Gal. 3. 27, 29. <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt. And if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heires according to the promiſe.</hi> By which we ſee (as was before obſerved) that whatever we have as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeed,</hi> we have it all in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and what we have in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we have it all as <hi>Abrahams ſeed;</hi> and that we are baptized into <hi>Chriſt:</hi> that is, our initiation into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and whatever we have in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and whatever we have as <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> is ſealed unto us in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. By which it is evident, that as circumciſion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118924:48"/> was to them, ſo baptiſme now to us is the token and ſeale of that covenant made with <hi>Abraham and his ſeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A further proofe of this we have alſo, Coll. 2. 11. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried with him in baptiſme, wherein alſo ye are riſen with him.</hi> Where we ſee, Firſt, that the thing ſignifyed or ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the ſpirituall fruit of circumciſion, was the circumciſion of the heart, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh; And that the very ſame is the ſpirituall fruit of baptiſme, ſignified and ſealed thereby, namely, a death and buriall to ſinne, and a ſpirituall reſurrection, which is the ſame with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh. Secondly, that, whereas Chriſt was circumciſed, and that not becauſe he had a body of ſinnes of his owne to be put off, but the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh of the members of his myſticall body; thoſe only who are in Chriſt receive this benefit, becauſe they have it by the circumciſion of Chriſt; ſo that whoever had, or have this circmciſion made without hands, are ſuppoſed to be in Chriſt, and members of his body, and thereby intitled to and intereſſed in his circumciſion. And here we ſee alſo that the very ſame we have in baptiſm, in the ſpiritual fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, that only thoſe who are in Chriſt receive that benefit, in as much as they are <hi>buryed with him in baptiſme, and riſen with him therein; with him,</hi> that is, as members of his body, <hi>who have this circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſinnes of the fleſh,</hi> buried &amp; riſen thus again. Thirdly, we ſee in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118924:49"/> laſt place, that the Apoſtle telleth them expreſly, that the benefit and fruit of circumciſion, which is the circumciſion made without hands, they had by being buryed and riſen with Chriſt in baptiſme; and therefore that they were compleat in Chriſt, in the ordinances of the Goſpel, without the <hi>rudiments of the world, the Jewiſh</hi> ceremonies, whether <hi>circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or any of the reſt; therefore there is the ſame thing done in the one, as was in the other, and this the ſame for ſubſtance to us, as that was to them, and this in the roome, and place or ſtead of that, ſo as we have no more in baptiſme, then they had in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to receive <hi>the ſigne of circumciſion, that he might be the father of them that beleive, becauſe he received it not only for himſelf, but alſo for them,</hi> as was ſhewed, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. for what he received <hi>as the father,</hi> he received it alſo for thoſe who are his <hi>Children.</hi> And as he received it for us, ſo we have it at this day, even circumciſion in baptiſm, in as much as therein we have the <hi>circumciſion made without hands,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayth, and have it alſo in the way of the ſame ordinance for ſubſtance (for ſuch is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to circumciſion, as was ſhewed before) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had it before Chriſt. And whether it is not for this reaſon, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſayd to be <hi>the father of circumciſion to them who are not of the circumciſion only, but alſo walk in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 12. Becauſe he received that ordinance for himſelf, and for all his ſeed, both Jewes and Gentiles, let it be conſidered. And that according to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we are to underſtand that command of God Gen. 17. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my covenant, thou and thy ſeed after thee in their generations; and this is my covenant, every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:118924:49"/>
                  <p>Now is it to be omitted, for a further evidence that baptiſme is in the roome and place of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that the <hi>lords ſupper</hi> is the ſame, for ſubſtance, with and in the place of the <hi>paſſover,</hi> as appeareth, 1 Cor 5. 7. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feaſt, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi> This he ſpeaketh in reference to <hi>their putting away from amongſt them the wicked perſon, v.</hi> 13, by whom, as by leaven, the whole lump, namely, the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in celebrating the ſupper he ſayth <hi>are one bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. was leavened; which purging of their Church, that they might ſo keep the feaſt, that is, might ſo eat the ſupper with unleavened bread, he could not have ſo expreſſed by ſuch phraſes, taken from the paſſover, had not the paſſover and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per been the ſame for ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obj.</label> Suppoſe it be granted, that baptiſme is the ſame for ſubſtance with, and in the place of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, namely, the ſeale or token of the ſame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as circumciſion was, and that the command of God lieth ſtill upon <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> even in all generations, that the token of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be obſerved, and kept by them: yet what is this for baptizing infants, in as much as baptiſme may ſeale unto us <hi>Abrahams covenant,</hi> although it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined only to perſons of ripe yeares, who can make confeſſion of their faith?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that what was cleared in the firſt uſe muſt here be conſidered; namely, that <hi>the application of the ſeale to the infant is part of the ſeale, or token of the covenant,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:118924:50"/> and is to be reputed part of the ſubſtance of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, ſo as the token of <hi>Abrahams covenant</hi> is not kept, nor that command of God fulfilled, (Gen. 17. 9.) in caſe it be left out. Therefore is it ſayd <hi>the uncircumciſed man-child hath broken the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. v.</hi> 14. The reaſon is, becauſe that branch thereof, which was peculiarly given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which makes the difference between his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that which was given before, namely, <hi>a bleſſing upon poſterity,</hi> is therein ſignified, and ſealed, as was ſhewed in the former uſe. Take away that branch of <hi>Abrahams covenant,</hi> wherein it differeth from that which the Lord had before given to his people, and the covenant under that conſideration as his, although other branches of it are kept, is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and if that branch of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant be not taken away, but continued unto us of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that part of the ſeale wherein it was ſignified, and confirmed, muſt continue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the application of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the infant ſhould be reputed only a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and not of the ſubſtance of it, yet if it be altered, it muſt be by a word from the Lord himſelfe ſo altered, or elſe it muſt continue. Any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein which by his inſtitution are altered, we have warrant accordingly to alter, otherwiſe not. As for inſtance, that inſtead of circumciſing, it ſhould now be baptizing with water, we have a word of inſtitution for it. And the application of the token of <hi>Abrahams covenant to the Female</hi> is alſo a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the Lord hath added; ſo we find, Act. 8. 12. when they beleeved <hi>Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdome of God, and the name of Ieſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women.</hi> And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118924:50"/> we have a reaſon for it even in that place, where bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ſaid to be the ſeal of Abrahams Covenant, namely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28. becauſe having there ſaid, <hi>as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt have put on Chriſt,</hi> he addeth in the next words, <hi>There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> Namely, as in other reſpects, ſo in this of their being <hi>baptized into Chriſt.</hi> Under the Law that could not be ſaid; <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 11. Deut. 16. 16.</note> the <hi>Jew</hi> had a priviledge, which the <hi>Greek</hi> had not; ſo had the Male, which the Female had not; but not ſo now. For this reaſon we now apply the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant as well to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, as to Males, which they did not. But if any will alter further, ſo as to forbid the application of the ſeal to Infants, it behoveth them to ſhew by what warrant from God they make that alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And whereas they of that opinion againſt Infant-Baptiſme think, that they are onely upon the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part, and therefore call for a precept, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to prove the lawfulneſſe thereof, thinking it ſufficient, becauſe, as they ſuppoſe, neither precept nor example can be found, thereupon to refuſe the practice of it, in this they are miſtaken. As for a command, there it is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my covenant therefore,</hi> that is, ſhalt perform the token of it, <hi>thou, and thy ſeed after thee in their Generations;</hi> which, as hath been ſhewed, is a command which lieth upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed now, in the times of the New Teſtament, and it behoveth ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infant-Baptiſme, to ſhew that God hath made ſuch an alteration in the token, or ſeal of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as that it is now not to be applyed unto Infants;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118924:51"/> and whereas the application of it unto them was a part of the token or ſeal thereof before Chriſt, that ſince Chriſt it hath, by a word of inſtitution from God, ceaſed ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This application of the token of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant unto Infants cometh not onely under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a duty, but alſo of a priviledge; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>he gave to</hi> Abraham <hi>the covenant of circumciſion, and ſo he begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and circumciſed him the eighth day.</hi> It was therefore a gift conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his: which being given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſpiritual ſeed in their generations, to him as the father of all them that believe, to all beleevers as his ſeed, a priviledge both to parents and to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; which I ſay being once given by God, who may preſume to take it away, without a word and warrant from himſelfe? and we know <hi>the gifts of God are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11. 29. therefore is it not to be imagined, that by him it ſhould be taken from his people, leaſt of all, that now in the times of the new Teſtament, his bounty to them ſhould be ſhort of what it was before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obj.</label> It will be objected yet further, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thus urged is onely from the Old Teſtament: but if the application of the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to Infants now had been intended, the New Teſtament had not been ſo ſilent in it, as not to leave us one precept or example for it.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, that the New Teſtament is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent in this matter; as for inſtance, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 38. where <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto the people, <hi>Repent and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the demiſſion of ſinnes, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118924:51"/> Ghoſt; for the promiſe is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</hi> that is, even to the Gentiles alſo, <hi>even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Namely, the promiſe of <hi>receiving the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which he ſaith they ſhould receive upon their repentance and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, according to that in <hi>Joel</hi> mentioned, verſ. 17. that <hi>in the laſt days God would poure out of his ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> as well upon Gentiles as Jewes; and not onely ſo, but alſo according to Gods <hi>promiſe unto Abraham;</hi> therefore he ſaith it was not onely unto them, but alſo <hi>to their children;</hi> for as we may grant that in <hi>Joel</hi> to be here meant, ſo we muſt not exclude that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for they are both as one in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and that alſo to the Gentiles, is a main branch of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, as we ſee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the</hi> Gentiles <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor may we confine that promiſe in <hi>Joel</hi> to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of tongues, and miracles, becauſe it is a promiſe that was not to expire with the Apoſtles times, <note place="margin">Acts 2. 17.</note> but extendeth to all the latter days, and unto all thoſe whom the Lord calleth among the Gentiles, and is yet in fulfilling, when all thoſe gifts are ceaſed; for that phraſe, <hi>the laſt dayes,</hi> in Scripture, ſignifieth all that ſpace of time from the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh to the end of the world, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 9. 26. And if the words be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it will appear, that the ordinary gifts of the ſpirit are alſo included therein. Mark the words; <hi>In the laſt days</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will poure out of my ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fleſh.</hi> This in the general. In particular, it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118924:52"/> followeth; Firſt, <hi>your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> This we may underſtand of extraordinary gifts, and propheſying, fulfilled in the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets extraordinarily inſpired, in the Primitive times, of uſe then in laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Church of the New Teſtament, being of the ſeed of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Secondly, <hi>and on my ſervants, and my handmaids, will I pour out of my ſpirit in thoſe days, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi> This muſt be meant of ordinary gifts, becauſe it is made a diſtinct thing to the former, as that which God would do for all his ſervants; he would give them the ſpirit of propheſie, as we ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. when <hi>John,</hi> would have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped the Angel, becauſe he had revealed ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies unto him, the Angel forbids him, ſaying, <hi>See thou do it not:</hi> and for this reaſon, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant,</hi> namely, in this thing, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, but alſo <hi>of thy brethren, that have the teſtimony of Jeſus, for the teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> Now every beleever hath the teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; ſo is it ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>The Dragon made Warre with the Church which keep the commandements of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> So chap. 1. 9. Therefore every beleever hath the ſpirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, although not ſo as to preach in the Church, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge forbidden unto Women, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34. 35.</note> yet to underſtand the propheſies, which the Saints of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordinarily had not; the propheſies were as things <hi>ſealed up</hi> in thoſe dayes, but Chriſt hath opened the ſeales of that book to us of the New Teſtament. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 10. 11. Dan. 12. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>A promiſe to this effect we have alſo to all beleevers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. when the ſpirit of truth is come, he ſhall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118924:52"/> lead you into all truth, and he ſhall ſhew you things to come. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 13, 20, 27. he ſaith not onely to fathers, and young men, but alſo unto little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in religion, that they had received the unction of the holy one, and they knew all things, being taught by that anointing. As theſe places muſt be underſtood of what is common to all beleevers, ſo (I ſuppoſe) it is alſo the meaning of that latter clauſe in that propheſie of <hi>Joel,</hi> cited by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>upon my ſervants, and upon my handmaids, I will poure out of my ſpirit in thoſe days, and they ſhal propheſie.</hi> By the more plentiful pouring forth of the ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beleevers, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39.) becauſe now the Church is of riper age, the Saints in ſome reſpect have an equal participation of the ſpirit, even in the uſe of ordinary gifts, as the Prophets of old had in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wayes: therefore what is the portion of all beleevers, in the times of the New Teſtament in that behalfe, is called the <hi>ſpirit of propheſie.</hi> Therefore is it that ſuch preaching, which we muſt ſuppoſe may bring us ſomething that is not good, is called <hi>Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that it muſt not be deſpiſed, as we would not quench the ſpirit. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. 20. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit, deſpiſe not propheſying, prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for our purpoſe, obſerve that here is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>to repenting and beleeving Jews</hi> to be baptized, they and their children. I ſay, to <hi>repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews;</hi> for the words of the Apoſtle cannot be meant, that the promiſe did belong to them, and their children onely as Jews, <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed, but as <hi>beleevers,</hi> and upon their <hi>converſion.</hi> Firſt, becauſe that which belonged to them properly as Jewes, was not Baptiſme but circumciſion. Secondly, becauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118924:53"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt had fully cleared that point before, upon a like occaſion, when the multitude came to him for baptiſme, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to ſay, we have Abraham for our father.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe he maketh the <hi>Gentiles</hi> caſe parallel with theirs, and ſaith the ſame promiſe did alſo belong to them, yet with the ſame limitation, namely, to <hi>ſo many of them</hi> onely <hi>as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> implying that it is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual call to faith and repentance, that gave to any ſuch a priviledge, either Jew or Gentile. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing their faith, and the work of God upon them, and upon no other account, endeavoureth thus to comfort them, and exhorts them to repent, that is, to go on as they had begun, and to embrace the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and to be baptized; and telleth them of their intereſt and priviledge by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and leaſt they ſhould be diſcouraged, becauſe of the greatneſſe of their ſinne, in rejecting, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying Chriſt, he telleth them that even the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould be received to the ſame priviledge, and that the promiſe was to them alſo; <hi>God would poure out of his ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> when they alſo ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and repent, as they now did.</p>
                  <p>Therefore alſo that clauſe, <hi>to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 14.</note> is likewiſe ſo to be underſtood, namely, not onely to <hi>them,</hi> but alſo to their <hi>Children</hi> did the ſame promiſe appertaine, (according to the tenour of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, whereof baptiſme is the ſeale, and in which the gift of the Holy Ghoſt is one thing promiſed) although it be not ſo expreſſed. As it is the manner of the Scripture, many times, to ſpeak ſo, as the ſenſe of the latter part of a ſentence is to be filled up from the former part, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118924:53"/> from the latter. As for inſtance, Pſal. 1. 6. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked ſhall periſh.</hi> Implying, that the Lord doth not ſo know the way of the wicked, and that the way of the righteous ſhal not not periſh. So <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>the feare of the wicked ſhall come upon him, but the deſire of the righteous ſhall be granted.</hi> Implying that the deſire of the wicked ſhall not be granted, and that the righteous ſhall be delivered from his feare. So when he ſaith here, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> It implyeth that the promiſe did belong to theſe Jewes upon their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall call, and to their children; and that when even the Gentiles, who were yet afarre off, ſhould be ſo called, that the ſame promiſe was to them and their children. And as we cannot ſuppoſe, that the promiſe of the gift of the holy Ghoſt, upon baptiſm, did belong to theſe Jewes without this call; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we think his meaning to be, that it did not belong to the Gentiles when ſo called, in the ſame latitude, namely, as well to them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo. Thus we ſee (I ſay) that the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not altogether ſilent in this matter, as alſo ſhall be made more to appeare anon, even from a further application of this point; and ſundry other arguments are pertinently, from thence, urged by ſeverall authors, which I ſhall not ſtay upon, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelfe to the point in hand, about the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer further, that as for the matters of the law, of which nature all the ordinances of the worſhip are, the New Teſtament ſpeakes but very briefly, and but by hints and touches, here and there,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118924:54"/> becauſe it ſuppoſeth the Church to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in thoſe things before, referring us for a full underſtanding of ſuch things, to what was received and known among the people of God from the Old Teſtament. For we muſt know that the times of the Old Teſtament were the ſeaſon wherein the Lord did inſtruct his people in his Law: As the times of the New Teſtament are the ſeaſon wherein he hath more fully unfolded the myſteries of the Goſpel, which were but darkly ſhadowed in the Old. So that, as our inſtruction in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel, is not to be expected onely from the Old, but muſt be taken from the New; ſo our eſtabliſhment in the Doctrine of the Law muſt not be taken only from the New, but alſo from the Old.</p>
                  <p>So we are to underſtand that in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John; <hi>ſince that time the Kingdome of God is preached.</hi> Not that then the Goſpel began, or that the Law was then ended, and laid aſide, and to be of no longer uſe. It is true, in the covenant of works made with our firſt parents in the ſtate of innocency, there was Law without Goſpel; but as to the Old Teſtament and the New, they both conſiſt of Law and Goſpel put together; onely they had moſt of the one, we of the other. But the meaning of that place in <hi>Luke</hi> is, that the time before <hi>Iohn</hi> was the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of inſtructing the Church in the Doctrine of the Law; therefore it followeth that ſince that time the Kingdome of God is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not the Kingdome of God began. And the time after <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> wherein the Church was to be more fully inſtructed in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>A further evidence of this we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 1. <hi>Give eare (O my people) to my law, I will open my mouth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118924:54"/> in a parable, I will utter dark ſayings of old.</hi> Who is it that ſpeaketh thus? It is Chriſt, of whom this was a propheſie, as we ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 35. <hi>All theſe things ſpake Ieſus in parables, that it might be fulfilled that was ſpoken by the Prophet, ſaying,</hi> I <hi>will open my mouth in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, I will utter things which have been kept ſecret from the foundation of the world.</hi> And as in the Pſalme he ſaith, <hi>Give eare O my people to my Law;</hi> ſo when he had ſpoken his parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 9. he addeth, <hi>He that hath an eare to hear, let him hear.</hi> Well, what is this Law that Chriſt will teach his people? (For we ſee, the Pſalme is a propheſie, wherein Chriſt is brought in teaching his Diſciples Law.) The Law that he teacheth is this; He relateth the hiſtory of the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> how they provoked and tempted God, and how he puniſhed them in the Wilderneſſe, and in <hi>Canaan;</hi> how they being afflicted did repent, and then ſinned yet more, and were not ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; and what the carriage of the Lord was towards them, all along, in his diſpenſing puniſhments, or mercy to them. This he calleth his teaching his people his Law, and this he ſaith he would <hi>declare to them, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandements, and might not be as their Fathers, a ſtubborn and rebellious generation, that ſet not their heart aright.</hi> v. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>And this is the ſcope of Chriſt in the parable of the ſower, where he ſheweth what befalls unfruitfull hearers, <hi>ſome as the High-way, ſome as the Stony, ſome as the Thorny ground;</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt makes parallel with that <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78. in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 3. So as by that Pſalme it is ſuppoſed, that when he inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and tutoured his people in the Wilderneſſe, and in Canaan, under the adminiſtrations of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118924:55"/> diſpenſing puniſhments and favours, as a Father to his Children, as occaſion ſerved, he then taught his people his law, and ſo as ſhould ſerve for the ages after Chriſt, as he ſaith, verſ. 5. of that Pſalm, <hi>He eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and appointed a law in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he commanded our Fathers, that they ſhould make them known to their Children, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children,</hi> even in the ages after Chriſt; for you ſee the Pſalme is a propheſie to be then fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this is becauſe however the Law of the Old and that of the New Teſtament, in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and in the particular duties required, do differ, yet as to the ſubſtance, or general nature of the Law, they are one and the ſame. As for inſtance, the generall nature of the Law, in both, we have in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>This doe and thou ſhalt live;</hi> And of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>The man that doth thoſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> So <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 29. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 11.</p>
                  <p>The Law preſcribes that rule and method of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which God hath ſet and ſanctified, in order to our enjoyment of life and bleſſedneſſe, in and from himſelfe. More particularly, three things there are in the generall nature of the Law, and in reſpect of each of them it is one and the ſame to us, as it was to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A commanded rule, or method of ſervice to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Then verily the firſt Covenant or Teſtament, had alſo Ordinances of Divine Worſhip.</hi> This word, <hi>alſo,</hi> ſuppoſeth both the one, and the other, to have ſuch Ordinances of Divine Worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this rule or method of ſervice, ſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118924:55"/> is holy, conſiſting of ſuch things as have in their uſe a ſpiritual efficacy above the common courſe of nature. Such were theirs to them, and ſuch are ours to us. <hi>The Law is holy, the Commandement holy, Rom.</hi> 7. 12. and <hi>the Law is ſpiritual.</hi> v. 14. Even thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are naturaly moral, being now to be performed to a ſpiritual and ſupernatural end, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other inſtitutions, namely, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with and life in God, are ſpirituall and holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe Ordinances, or Commandements to be obſerved under <hi>penalties,</hi> both corporal and ſpiritual; the word <hi>life</hi> comprehends both, which is our caſe as well as theirs. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>They were all baptized, and did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> yet <hi>fell in the Wilderneſs for their luſting, for their Idolatry, Fornication, tempting God, and murmuring.</hi> Now (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>all theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them for examples,</hi> and were <hi>written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore, let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leaſt he fall,</hi> namely, as they fell. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle to us of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. <hi>Tempt not God, nor provoke him, as they did in the Wilderneſs, leaſt he ſwear againſt you in his wrath, as he did againſt them.</hi> And this he ſpeaketh to <hi>beleevers,</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) whom he calls <hi>the people of his paſture, and ſheep of his hand.</hi> Pſal. 95. <hi>Holy brethren, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Heavenly calling,</hi> Heb. 3. 1. whom alſo he ſuppoſeth to be in Chriſtian Churches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. And we find that the profanation of the Sacrament by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was puniſhed alſo by corporall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many are fallen a ſleep.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118924:56"/> I ſay, the Law is a command to be obſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on penalties and rewards; <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 12. Heb. 6. 10.</note> onely to us his rewards and puniſhments are more in that which is ſpiritual, and leſs in things corporal, then they were to them.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this to be under a covenant of works. It is true, the Law to man in the ſtate of Innocency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel was added, was a covenant of works; but ever ſince, both to them before, and to us after Chriſt, the Law hath been as it were incorporated with the Goſpel, as thereby become part of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</hi> Therefore the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> is called the <hi>Teſtament</hi> of Chriſt, as well as the Law given to us by Chriſt himſelf; that the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> this the <hi>New,</hi> and both confirmed by his blood; that in the type by the blood of Bulls and Goats, this in the anſwer-type by his owne blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtatour; whereupon, nether the firſt Teſtament was dedicated without blood.</hi> Now the Teſtament of Chriſt, ſo confirmed, muſt needs be of the covenant of grace, not of works. Therefore alſo what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of the Law given by him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 12. 14. <hi>It is not in Heaven that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Goſpel, in oppoſition to the Law, as in it ſelfe conſidered without the Goſpel, or as a covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>Before the Fall the Law was given by God as Lord of his Creature; but ſince the Fall it hath been the Law of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> which maketh it ceaſe to be a covenant of works.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt in his Kingdome, is ſo our <hi>Lord</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:118924:56"/> as he is alſo our <hi>Head,</hi> and we the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and quickened by his ſpirit, and therefore part of our duty therein required is, that it be done by his ſtrength. <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 5. Philip. 1. 11.</note> In the covenant of works, the Law was <hi>Do this and live;</hi> but in the covenant of grace, it is <hi>Do this in the ſtrength of Chriſt and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe our ſtate and condition as ſubjects of his Kingdome, dependeth not upon our keeping the Law, but upon free grace in Chriſt by faith, although our comfort in that Kingdom and State, be much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we keep or break that Law. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandements</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and keepeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he it is that loveth me, &amp; he ſhal be loved of my father, and I wil love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> So we are to underſtand thoſe words, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we are free from,</hi> and <hi>dead to the Law,</hi> and are <hi>not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> that is, in reſpect of our ſtate and condition, or of the juſtifying of our perſons. In the ſtate of innocency, <hi>Do this and live</hi> was the covenant, in reſpect of ſtate; therefore <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſooner ſinned, but he was in a ſtate of eternal death; but to us onely in reſpect of the comforts in that ſtate wherein we are, as ſubjects of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and members of his body. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are puniſhed for ſin, yet not with eternal death, but with temporal puniſhments, whether cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſpiritual; and that out of love to do us good, as from a Father; our ſtate in Chriſt continues ſtill. Therfore although we are bound by this Law as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdome, yet we are free from the law in reſpect of that legal ſtate, as under a covenant of works.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe however we are puniſhed by Chriſt for ſinne, yet the matter is wholly taken up by him in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118924:57"/> his Kingdom, and we are not carried out thence to be puniſhed, or thrown to hell. Therefore are we free from the Law as to the eternal curſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that when he puniſheth for ſinne, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth therein according to the nature of the <hi>juſtice of his Kingdom,</hi> which is the <hi>juſtice of a Father,</hi> which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him in puniſhing to aime not only at the glory of his juſtice, but alſo at the good of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; which end if he can attain by ſparing, he is engaged even in juſtice, and that he may be a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father, to ſpare: or if a leſſer affliction will do it, to take a leſſe: and although ſometimes when he ſees cauſe he will not ſpare, and when a leſſer affliction will not do the work he takes a greater, and comes with <hi>ſeven times more,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> yet never to puniſh any of his children according to the full deſert of any ſinne. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our iniquities, Pſal.</hi> 103. 10. Now this is not according to the tenour of a covenant of works, for there is no ſuch liberty taken; there is no ſparing, becauſe the end of puniſhment therein is not the good of the perſon puniſhed, but onely the glory of his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, that although one ingredient in the general nature of the Law, both before and ſince the coming of Chriſt, be, that it is a command under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties; yet it follows not that either they were, or that we now are, under a covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>I have made ſo large a digreſſion upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe ſome do inſiſt ſo much upon this point againſt Infant-baptiſme, alledging that the new Teſtament is ſo ſilent in it; for by that which hath been ſaid of the general nature of the Law, to be one and the ſame to the people of God under both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118924:57"/> we ſee clearly the reaſon of theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how God could make the time of the old Teſtament to be the ſeaſon wherin he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his people in his Law, and that for all ages afterwards, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>The law and the Prophets were until John, and ſince that time the kingdom of God is preached:</hi> implying that the doctrin of the Law was unfolding until then.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, why the Lord Chriſt, who is <hi>the Apoſtle of our profeſſion, and was faithful to him that appointed him, as</hi> Moſes <hi>alſo was faithful in all his houſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 1.</note> that is, in all the ſervice of it, ſhould ſpeak ſo little in his new Teſtament concerning the Law, which is the rule which he hath ſet for the ſervice of that his houſe; namely, becauſe he could look upon that, for the greateſt part, to be done already. And ſhould he have been more particular therein, he had taken his people off from the ſtudy of the old Teſtament, which he would not doe, ſince it was written for our learning, yea he purpoſely avoyds it, that he might oblige his people to that ſtudy. His faithfulneſſe in the houſe of God did beſpeak it of him. Therefore whoever ſhall confine himſelf only to the new Teſtament, to finde out the law of Gods worſhip and ſervice, he ſhall never finde it, not onely as to Infant-baptiſme, but alſo to all other Ordinances whatſoever; becauſe, as I ſaid, the new Teſtament ſpeaks of things only by hints, here and there, for the moſt part, and as ſuppoſing many things then alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy known, when that was written, and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among his people. As for inſtance, he ſaith of his Church, (even that Church wherein <hi>Timothy was inſtructed touching his behaviour,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> and therefore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118924:58"/> meant of a viſible Church) that it is his <hi>Houſe;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">See p. 28.</note> and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>Temple of God;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. But where is the nature of the houſe, or Temple, unfolded in the new Teſtament? For that we muſt goe to the old; and there we finde, that a Temple, or an houſe of God, muſt be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from that which is common, and made ſacred to his preſence; and ſuch muſt a people be, who are now his Houſe and Church; which preſence of his when he totally withdraws, he calleth it a profaning or defiling of his Sanctuary. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 21. <hi>I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane my ſanctuary the excellency of your ſtrength;</hi> that is, he would make it common, and to be as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Again, the word <hi>ſeparate,</hi> is ſometimes uſed in the new Teſtament, as, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. which is of neceſſity to be underſtood by him that would underſtand the Ordinances of God, and ſervice of his houſe, or the houſe it ſelfe; for they all are ſeparated things. But we finde not in the new Teſtament what it is, but in the old we muſt ſearch, and there we finde it often made oppoſite to that which is common, that is, which is and worketh onely within the common road of nature; therefore we finde, that then a thing is ſeparated, when it is ſet apart for a ſupernaturall efficacy and end, of which nature all the Ordinances of the worſhip then were, and are ſo ſtill. So for the Sabbath, where ſhall we find, that the firſt day of the week is to be <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and kept holy,</hi> as the <hi>Reſt day of the Lord,</hi> as the Seventh day was, if you have not recourſe to the fourth Commandement, where the command is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the generall duty of remembring, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Reſt day, whatever that day fall to be, as was before obſerved?<note place="margin">Page 75.</note>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:118924:58"/>
                  <p>I might give many ſuch inſtances, I ſhall name but one more, and that is this, <hi>the applying of the token of Abrahams Covenant to infants;</hi> which muſt have been more particularly appointed in the new Teſtament, had not the <hi>command of God,</hi> when he gave to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that Covenant and the ſeal thereof, been ſo expreſſely fixed upon the <hi>generall duty of keeping the token of the Covenant,</hi> yea whatever that token prove to be (for God did intend to change it, as was ſhewed) And withall the application of it to the Infant ſo expreſſely made an eſſential part thereof, as being that wherein was ſignified and ſealed that branch of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, which made it to be his, and to differ from what was given before, in reference to which alſo, and to the ſeals thereof, he was called the Father of them that believe, and therefore receiv'd both the one, and the other, both for himſelfe and us, as was ſhewed before; namely, <hi>a bleſſing upon families, in order to the multiplying of the ſpiritual ſeed.</hi> Which being conſidered, the ſilence of the new Teſtament in this matter of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, is an argument rather for it then againſt it; becauſe had it not been taken for granted, and as a thing commonly received by all the Churches, from the light of the old Teſtament, that this token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant ſhould alſo be applyed unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, thoſe who had ſo many queſtions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to be decided by the Apoſtles, had never let ſo great a priviledge go ſo quietly, without ſo much as a queſtion put about it. And it had been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the Lord ſhould have given a caution for leaving Infants out of this new adminiſtration, that we might have known his minde, had he ſo intended.</p>

                  <p>Hence we ſee a reaſon why the Apoſtle faith of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118924:59"/> children of beleeving parents, that they are not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or uncleane, but holy.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. one reaſon is, becauſe they come under this word of bleſſing from God, in as much as that word was confirmed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo to all beleevers; <hi>Bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> That which God bleſſeth he ſanctifieth, and ſeparateth from that which is common or unclean; As it is ſaid of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, he bleſſed the Sabbath day, and ſanctified it, that is, made it a day which ſhould not be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted common, but holy. Nor are the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers under a bleſſing onely in a common way of providence, as he bleſſeth the corne and the beaſts of the field, as hath been ſhewed, (although accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary courſe of cauſes and things in nature, it muſt be acknowledged a bleſſing to be born and brought up of beleeving parents) for if that were all, it would not make their children holy.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>upholdeth all things by the word of his power. Heb.</hi> 1. 3. ſo as the common courſe of things in nature is not without a <hi>word of bleſſing</hi> from God. <hi>The earth which drinketh in the raine that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God. Heb.</hi> 6. 7. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 38. yet here is no <hi>holineſs</hi> in all this, becauſe this is done in the common courſe of nature; and that which maketh any thing to be holy, is ſomething which is ſpiritual and ſupernatural, or ſeparated from that common road. And this is the caſe of Infants of beleeving parents; they are not onely under a <hi>word of common providence,</hi> but alſo under ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>word of bleſſing from God,</hi> by meanes whereof beleevers are made bleſſings to their children, in that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118924:59"/> which is <hi>ſpiritual and ſupernatural,</hi> even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their ſoules to God, without which word of bleſſing all prayers and good example, or meanes of education whatſoever, are not ſo effectual there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Hence it is that the Apoſtle puts that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Gentiles and the Jewes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a wild Olive and a good Olive tree. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>If thou wert cut out of the Olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good Olive tree.</hi> That which made this difference was not to be found in that which was meerly natural; for the Jewes were borne in originall ſinne, and corrupted thereby as much as the Gentiles; but in ſomething ſupernatural, namely, becauſe the Jewes, though they were ſinful too, yet they were under the means of grace, and they had God engaged by covenant to them and their children for their good. But as for the Gentiles, he left them to their natural condition, without ſuch means to mend them, nor was God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſo to them for their good; but they were under the curſe of God, therefore they grew wild as a tree in the Wilderneſſe that hath none to order it. And ſo were all thoſe that came of them, ſuch children of ſuch parents, alike under the curſe of God in ſinne, and not looked after or regarded by the Lord, as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts,</hi> 14. 16. <hi>He in times paſt ſuffered all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to walk in their own ways.</hi> And whereas the Jews are called the <hi>natural branches</hi> of this good Olive tree, and are ſaid <hi>to be Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles Gal.</hi> 2. 15. this is not ſpoken becauſe this difference was from nature onely, and not from that which is ſupernatural, but becauſe this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had by <hi>birth,</hi> according to the <hi>covenant of God with Abraham.</hi> And we ſee by that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that look what priviledge the Jewes had of this kind, the beleeving Gentiles do now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſince their being graffed into the ſame Olive tree, from whence the Jewes for a time are broken off; and that when the Jewes ſhall be again graffed into it, they ſhall enjoy the ſame again, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>p.</hi> 39, 40, 41, &amp;c. Therefore I ſay, this is one thing which makes this difference between the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers, and of unbeleevers, that they are holy, and theſe common or unclean, becauſe they are under ſuch a word of bleſſing which theſe are not; yea though we cannot with certainty affirm of this or that Infant of a beleever that it is inherently holy yet holy as thus ſeparated and differenced, from thoſe who are common, by that word of bleſſing from God, under which they are. As we cannot upon certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affirm of any particular perſon in the Church that he is inherently holy, becauſe he may make a lye in his confeſſion, yet of every ſuch perſon we can ſay he is in that ſenſe holy, namely, as ſeparated unto God in that relation, and thereby differenced from thoſe who are common or uncleane.</p>
                  <p>To this I adde, that as it is a neceſſary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the confeſſion of one who is received into <hi>Church relation,</hi> that therein be held forth in words and actions, that which giveth a <hi>poſitive ground of hope</hi> that he is <hi>inherently holy;</hi> ſo in this promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning <hi>his purpoſe of election ſo by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> as hath been ſhewed, we have no leſs ground of <hi>hope</hi> concerning <hi>Infants</hi> of beleevers. In the one we have a perſons own <hi>profeſſion</hi> concerning his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate and intereſt in Chriſt, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 14. Matth. 10. 14.</note> in the other we have what God himſelf <hi>profeſſeth,</hi> how he hath <hi>ſeparated them</hi> unto himſelf, and made them <hi>part of his kingdom,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:118924:60"/> and partakers of the <hi>bleſſing of his covenant.</hi> And as a perſon of ripe years is received to baptiſme, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is certainly known to be inherently holy, but upon his <hi>profeſſion</hi> to be ſuch, wherein both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Church may be deceived; ſo upon that which God hath ſaid concerning Infants are they to be received alſo. Nor let it ſeem ſtrange that thoſe who are made holy from a word of bleſſing from the Lord, are by him appointed to have the ſeale of that word and covenant by which they are ſo made holy, as in the former uſe was proved, that he hath ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and appointed. Which alſo is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſuch children are by the Apoſtle called <hi>holy,</hi> namely, becauſe they are not onely within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo are appointed of God to be a <hi>ſubject recipient</hi> of the <hi>ſeale</hi> of that <hi>covenant.</hi> The ſeale is holy, and thoſe to whom it is applyed muſt be ſo, or elſe it is profaned and made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>As for that interpretation given of that place by ſome, <hi>elſ were your children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> to be meant, that elſe their children were baſtards, but now they were legitimate; It cannot be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle; becauſe ſo the Apoſtle had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing to the ſatisfaction of thoſe who had put the Queſtion to him about putting away an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Wife. For it ſeems the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had written to him, and had put certain queſtions to be anſwered by him, as we ſee verſ. 1. whereof that was one. Now for him to ſay, that a beleeving Husband might lawfully keep his Wife ſtill, though an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, elſe were their children baſtards, had been to leave them as dark and unſatiſfied as before; for that had been but <hi>idem per idem,</hi> or barely to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118924:61"/> the thing. But it is evident the Apoſtle bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that of the childrens being holy as an argument to prove their lawful continuance in that relation, notwithſtanding one of them was an unbeleever. Nor can we ſuppoſe the Apoſtle would ſo reaſon, that except one of the married couple be a beleever, their children are baſtards. Moreover the holineſſe here mentioned is ſuppoſed to be ſuch as the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever contributeth nothing to it, he is ſanctified, he doth not ſanctifie, therefore cannot be meant of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy of birth, which muſt be as well from the one as from the other, ſince marriage is an ordinance not peculiar to the Church of God, but common unto all mankind.</p>
                  <p>By this anſwer of his it appears, that it was a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſcruple that did trouble them, namely, whereas under the Law it was a ſinne for one of the Church of the Jewes to marry a ſtrange Wife, that is, one who was not of the Church, and in ſuch caſe they were commanded to put away their Wives, and to ſeparate themſelves from them as being polluted by them, as we ſee in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 11. &amp; 9. 12. as it was alſo the ſinne of the old world, that <hi>the ſons of God,</hi> that is, they of the Church, <hi>did take in marriage the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men,</hi> that is, of the poſterity of <hi>Caine:</hi> Such was the Law of the communion of Saints alſo, in the Church, even in thoſe dayes. Therefore the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> put the Queſtion to the Apoſtle, whether now alſo in the times of the New Teſtament, one of the Church might continue in Wedlock with one not of the Church, but an infidell. To this the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that if the unbelieving Wife was not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in or by the believing Husband, that is, if any Church-Law was thereby broken, ſo as their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118924:61"/> in that relation was not lawful but did cauſe pollution to the beleever, that then their <hi>Children</hi> muſt not be reputed <hi>holy,</hi> but <hi>unclean</hi> or common, ſo as if they would deny the Wife mariage communion upon that account, they muſt deny their children all ſpiritual communion in the Church. For ſuch was the Law to the Jewes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. <hi>They put away their Wives and ſuch as were born of them alſo, and that according to the command of</hi> Ezra, <hi>and according to the Law.</hi> By that which they granted he proves that which they did queſtion.</p>

                     <label>Obj.</label> If it be objected, that upon this account, not onely <hi>children of beleevers,</hi> but alſo <hi>Nations</hi> muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted holy, becauſe the promiſe is that beleevers ſhall be <hi>bleſſings alſo unto Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> The caſe is not the ſame, for children are immediately under this word of bleſſing in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie relation, as the people of God in the Church are immediately under that <hi>bleſſing,</hi> which <hi>the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth out of Sion.</hi> But as for Nations, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in a more remote capacity, by means of what the Saints are in their families and in the Church.

                  <p>To this I adde, that children are in the power of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and at their diſpoſing, and ſo as when they, in their ſanctification, or being made holy, give up themſelves to God by faith, and obedience to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, their children are therein vertually given up alſo, in as much as a beleever in ſome reſpect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth up to God together with himſelf all in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                     <label>Obj.</label> It will be objected yet further, That the Jews are ſaid to be <hi>holy,</hi> even the whole people of the Jews, who now are unbeleevers; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy; and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches:</hi> yet have they no right to <hi>baptiſme;</hi> and therefore that this <hi>holineſs of the children</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. be it from their intereſt in the <hi>Covenant of God with Abraham,</hi> is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Infant-Baptiſme, becauſe the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews alſo are ſuppoſed by us to be holy upon the ſame account, and <hi>holineſs</hi> to be taken in the ſame ſenſe in both places.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, It is true, thoſe two places are parallel, and in that ſenſe they have been both above alledged to prove that branch of Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning a <hi>bleſſing upon poſterity,</hi> in order to the multiplying of beleevers. And yet it is as true, that there is a great difference between them. As for that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. the Apoſtle therein ſpeaketh of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons that they are holy; but that is not the meaning of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons of the Jews who perſiſt in unbelief, or that the whole people of the Jewes are now in the times of the New Teſtament holy, in any ſenſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; for it is expreſly ſaid of them that they are <hi>broken off from the holy root:</hi> v. 20. are <hi>caſt away,</hi> v. 15. are <hi>enemies,</hi> and ſo uncleane, and profane, and therefore not <hi>holy,</hi> v. 28. But whereas the Jewes are there ſaid to be holy, although it is indeed ſpoken of the whole body of that people, yet is it not to be underſtood as meant of that whole in the full extent thereof, but of that people onely, in reſpect of that part thereof, or of thoſe perſons which either were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118924:62"/> or in Gods time ſhould be afterwards converted. As it is an uſual manner of ſpeech in Scripture, by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> to attribute that to the whole, which yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly &amp; peculiarly belongeth to a part; as for inſtance, it is ſaid, <hi>The ten Kings ſhall hate the Whore and burn her fleſh with fire, Rev.</hi> 17. 16. and yet it is meant but of part of the number, for it is ſaid of the ſame Kings that <hi>they ſhall lament her fall. Rev.</hi> 18. 9. So it is ſaid of the <hi>Theeves</hi> that were crucified with Chriſt, that <hi>they reviled him, Matth.</hi> 27. 44. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 32. yet it was but one of them that did it, the other <hi>rebuked his fellow,</hi> and honoured Chriſt with that petition to him, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome, Luk.</hi> 23. 39. And according to that manner of ſpeaking it might have been alſo ſaid, that the Theeves did acknowledge Chriſt upon the croſs. Thus <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 34. it is ſaid, <hi>the people anſwered him,</hi> we have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever: yet it was but ſome one, or ſome few, among the people, not the whole people, that made this objection. So <hi>John</hi> 7. 20. Such like phraſes do ſpeak rather to the <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>ſort,</hi> then to the particular perſons intended by them. Thus we are to underſtand that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. when he ſaith of the people of the Jewes that they are <hi>holy,</hi> namely, what properly and peculiarly belongeth to a part, even to thoſe of them who either then were, or afterward ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he aſcribeth to the whole, and in reſpect of that part he calleth the whole body of that people <hi>holy.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſet forth the <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>ſort</hi> of people, namely <hi>Jews,</hi> not the particular perſons that ſhould be called. Now in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. his purpoſe is to aſſert ſuch particular perſons to be holy. And that the Apoſtle is thus to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118924:63"/> be underſtood, it is evident becauſe elſe there will be a contradiction in the Text; for he ſaith of the whole people as well, that they were <hi>caſt away, and enemies,</hi> as that they are <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>beloved for their Fathers ſake;</hi> Now that theſe ſhould be both true of the whole it cannot be; and all were not broken off in the Apoſtles time, but <hi>ſome of the branches were cut off,</hi> v. 17. <hi>and blindneſs did happen to Iſrael</hi> not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>but in part.</hi> v. 25. nor is it otherwiſe at this day. And as when he ſaith of the whole people, that they were <hi>caſt away,</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> it is meant of the whole, onely in reſpect of that refuſe part which perſiſt in unbeliefe. So when he ſaith of the whole that they are <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>beloved,</hi> it muſt be meant of the whole, onely in reſpect of that better part which either had beleeved, or ſhould afterward beleeve. Nor is there cauſe it ſhould ſeem ſtrange that the Apoſtle when he ſaith <hi>the lump is holy,</hi> ſhould referre to them who are yet unborn, and ſo cannot be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, if it be conſidered, that the covenant to which the Apoſtle hath relation in that place, was made not only to perſons then in being, but alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all poſterity, and that the lump of which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is of the ſame extent, and ſo to be underſtood as well when he ſaith the Jewes are <hi>holy,</hi> as when he ſaith they were <hi>enemies</hi> and <hi>caſt away;</hi> Nor can it be imagined, that he ſhould, either in the one or the other, intend onely thoſe who either then were, or ſhould afterward at one certain time be in being, but ſuch a lump or whole he meaneth, as ſhould have a being ſucceſſively, and part after part; therefore may well ſay of the whole that it is <hi>holy,</hi> though it be onely in reſpect of a part as yet unborne. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince theſe two places do ſo much differ, and in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118924:63"/> as much as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith of ſuch particular perſons that they are holy, the argument from thence is ſtrong and pertinent, all that which is objected from this other Scripture not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>

                  <p>Hence alſo we ſee the reaſon of our Saviours ſpeech to his Diſciples, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> Of ſuch, that is, not as ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as was ſhewed before, <hi>p.</hi> 49, 50. But his meaning is, that the Kingdom conſiſteth alſo of ſuch, even of little children. I ſay the reaſon,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, why he mentions here the <hi>Kingdom</hi> upon this occaſion, ſaith not, of ſuch is the Church of God, or of ſuch are my people, but of ſuch is the <hi>kingdom.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe this <hi>kingdom</hi> of which he ſpeaketh, <note place="margin">P. 62.</note> is that which was begun in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the greatneſſe whereof is founded in a great part in that promiſe made to him, of a bleſſing upon fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and poſterity, ſo as upon this account the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers are to be reputed part of that Kingdom, and in beleevers bringing their children unto Chriſt, that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is in part fulfilled, that being a means appointed and deſigned by God, whereby the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhould grow to its intended greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reaſon alſo why our Saviour ſays, they ſhould therefore <hi>ſuffer little children to come unto him, becauſe the kingdom doth conſiſt of ſuch,</hi> namely, becauſe they being part of that Kingdom, the promiſe of the bleſſing of the Kingdom did alſo belong to them. And as this is part of the Goſpel of the Kingdom, that beleevers ſhould be bleſſings to their children, namely, ſo as they ſhould be means of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118924:64"/> and in that reſpect of bringing them to Chriſt, by an internall work of grace upon their hearts, ſo it was very ſuitable and neceſſary, that they ſhould in ſuch externall waies alſo bring them to Chriſt, as there they did, that he <hi>might lay his hands upon them and bleſſe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the reaſon alſo why our Saviour was ſo much <hi>diſpleaſed,</hi> and angry with his Diſciples, for their <hi>rebuking thoſe that brought them,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the word is, and it is to ſet forth the moſt paſſionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation had againſt a perſon. The ſame word is uſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 24. to ſet out the diſpleaſure taken againſt <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> by the other Diſciples for their ambitious requeſt, to be <hi>one at the right hand, and the other at the left hand of Chriſt in his Kingdom. When they heard it,</hi> (ſaies the Text) <hi>they were moved with indignation againſt the two brethren,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The reaſon (I ſay) why he was ſo much moved with anger upon this occaſion; namely, becauſe not onely his affection to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and the children, but alſo his own intereſt, ſo much concerned in it, led him to it. His Kingdom is his portion, and hath been his great deſigne, from the beginning of the world. <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 34.</note> The greatneſſe and increaſe of this his Kingdome depends much upon little ones being brought to Chriſt: ſo as when his Diſciples forbad Infants to be brought to him, they croſſed him in his deſigne and intereſt. Let all the true Diſciples of Chriſt be afraid to incur his anger, upon this account. Now for our purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if infants are part of the Kingdom of God, and ſo the bleſſings of that kingdom belong unto them, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in a like caſe. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47 <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:118924:64"/> ſince baptiſm is the ſeale of our entrance into this kingdom, and the bleſſings of it; and <hi>they a part of this Kingdom, &amp; therfore receive the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this command of Chriſt upon ſuch grounds, was not given to his Diſciples onely for that ſhort time wherein he was to be with them in the fleſh. It was recorded after his aſcention, and of a perpetuall obligation to the Diſciples of Chriſt, in all ages then to come. What was ſo written, was written for our learning; and we have no other ſuch externall way of bringing them to Chriſt, that he may <hi>lay his hands upon them, and bleſſe them,</hi> but in baptiſme, wherein our initiation into the Kingdom of God, and the bleſſings of that kingdome, are ſealed. And as by <hi>his laying his hands upon them, and bleſſing them</hi> at that time, we ſee that infants are capable of benefit by outward ſignes, which themſelves cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider nor underſtand; ſo that in baptiſme now, the Lord Chriſt in doing his part therein, doth the ſame thing in effect, as then he did to thoſe children, when <hi>he took them in his armes, laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them;</hi> in as much as their entrance into his kingdom, and the bleſſings of it, as I ſaid, is therein ſignified and ſealed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to this I may adde, that unto whom he is a <hi>King,</hi> to them he is alſo a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Therefore as of ſuch is his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſo ſuch are his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> and are made <hi>Diſciples,</hi> when their parents are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe they are then in the way of the ſpirits teaching, as hath been ſhewed. Called Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. Circumciſion called a yoke put on the neck of the Diſciples. This, by the way, I obſerve, as a ſufficient anſwer to that argument brought by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118924:65"/> ſome, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. againſt baptizing Infants; yea ſuppoſing it ſhould be granted, what they ſay to be the ſenſe of that place, namely, that onely thoſe who are made Diſciples may be baptized. Although more might be ſaid, about thoſe words, in anſwer to it, namely, that in the words, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. we have, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> a part for the whole, (an uſuall form of ſpeech in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) for we know the Apoſtles commiſſion did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as well to a ſetting up of other ordinances, as of baptiſme. Therefore when he ſaith, <hi>Goe teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, Goe teach them, and enter them into the practice of the worſhip of the Goſpel: of which, among other things, the application of the token of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant to Infants may be a part, any thing in that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>No more at preſent upon that ſubject. But having had occaſion in opening this point to ſpeake of ſeverall things concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt; I muſt adde ſomething, though but briefly by way of application alſo upon that.</p>

                  <p>Therefore a ſixth uſe of this point may be, that from thence we learn to rectifie ſome miſtakes about this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to remove ſuch prejudice, and hard thoughts, as may be apt to lie in the minds of men againſt it; <note place="margin">Dan 7. 27. Pſal 47. 3.</note> namely, whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high. And that they ſhall fill the world; and the Lord ſhall ſubdue the people under them, and the Nations under their feet.</hi> Theſe may ſeem to be hard ſayings, and not to be born. This doctrine, will ſome ſay, teacheth the people of God
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118924:65"/> to be ill ſubjects, to graſpe and reach after power, and to be diſturbers of Commonwealths; and indeed it is true, if things be not rightly underſtood, there ſeemeth juſt cauſe of ſuch offence; but if matters be ſcanned, and conſidered rightly, there is no ſuch cauſe of any jealouſies or fears at all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By that which hath been ſaid in opening this point we ſee, that although it muſt be granted, that as the Church of Chriſt is a growing thing, and <hi>of the encreaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 9. 7.</note> and therefore muſt fill the world at laſt; and that what the Lord hath ſaid of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>a poſſeſſing of the gate of his enemies,</hi> muſt be fulfilled in its time; yet that God will take a moſt naturall, genuine, and ſatisfying way to bring his people to ſuch power. You ſee he will doe it by <hi>multiplying the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> He will not doe it by violence, he declareth againſt it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 4. but by the word of truth, meekneſſe, and righteouſneſſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. Nor by unrighteous waies of any kind; <hi>The ſcepter of his kingdom is a right ſcepter;</hi> No feare of any unrighteouſneſſe in it, it is a ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ever ſhall be ſo; When the Lords moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall be exalted above the hills, it will be the Lords mountain ſtill. The weapons therefore of its warfare are ſpirituall; the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God, is that whereby it ſhall ſubdue the world; and that alſo as it is managed by his Saints in their families and congregations, the Lord ſo making them bleſſings to one another, and his kingdom thereby to be <hi>as leaven,</hi> whereby the <hi>whole lump</hi> by degrees, at laſt, ſhall be ſeaſoned with the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the nature of that conqueſt, whereby his kingdom ſhall be made ſo great.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve moreover, that this power, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, ſhall be in the hands of <hi>Abrahams ſeed.</hi> So the promiſe is, <hi>Thy ſeed,</hi> even his ſpirituall ſeed, for that promiſe was made to his ſeed of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament alſo, (as hath been ſhewed) <hi>ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies.</hi> It is not ſaid, that ſuch as are pretenders to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed ſhal have this power. The ſame ſeed which God will bleſſe, and thereby multiply, ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies. Therefore alſo, when this is brought to paſſe, it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 47. &amp; 97. Rev. 11. 15, 16. which could not be ſo ſaid, if this power was to be given to any but his own people. Therefore ſince it is to be in ſuch hands, it will be matter of rejoycing, not of any griefe at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Obj.</label> It will be objected, that even hypocrites in the Church, till they are diſcovered, are in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, to be reputed by the Church to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and to be received to all externall priviledges and ordinances accordingly; therefore we cannot appropriate or reſtraine this promiſe only to the true ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, It is true, that even ſuch are to be ſo reputed, and received by the Church; but it is one thing what the Church may and muſt doe in her adminiſtrations, another thing what God will doe in his work of providence. Now this promiſe is of what God will do in his work; he will cauſe the <hi>ſeed of Abraham to poſſeſſe the gate of his enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Scripture ſpeaketh of what is to be done by the Church to her members, it taketh in all the <hi>branches of that vine,</hi> both good and bad; but where it ſpeaketh of what God hath promiſed to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118924:66"/> doe, or give, unto the Church, it confineth it onely to beleevers. Yea, even thoſe externall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, in the adminiſtrations of the worſhip, although the Church may impart them even to hypocrites, being members, (for ſuch will get in unawares) yet God hath not given them unto ſuch, but to believers onely. As for hypocrites, they are partakers of them upon another account, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe among other priviledges which God hath given unto his people, this is one, that they ſhall have to doe with one another in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, in the ordinances of the worſhip, as <hi>confeſſours;</hi> and the Church-relation to be built upon <hi>confeſſion,</hi> and the ordinances given to them not as beleevers onely, but as <hi>confeſſours. Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 17, 19. Upon this it is that hypocrites alſo are received by the Saints, when unknown, to the ſame externall priviledges with themſelves, becauſe they alſo are <hi>confeſſours</hi> of Chriſt. Not that they have any right to claime any of them, though the Church have warrant to give them unto ſuch, being claimed by them; they take them at their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, the people of God doe but their duty, although they doe not theirs. Were this power therefore, of poſſeſſing the gate, to be given by the Church, as part of that which ſhe is to adminiſter unto her members, it would follow that it ſhould be imparted in the ſame latitude, namely, to the ſame perſons, together with other priviledges to which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours are received in the Church, and ſo hypocrites would it may be have the greateſt ſhare. But Chriſt hath left no ſuch <hi>Legacy</hi> in his <hi>Teſtament</hi> to the Church, to be a diſpoſer or diſpencer of civil power. <hi>His Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> as hath been ſhewed.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118924:67"/> This promiſe therefore ſpeaketh not what the Church ſhall doe, but what God the moſt high will doe, who <hi>ruleth in the kingdome of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will. Dan.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, yet becauſe what God doth in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he doth it by men, and by Saints too among others, although not in a Church capacity; for a further anſwer to this objection, I muſt alſo adde, that in thoſe daies, wherein the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall obtain this power, the Church ſhall be brought to that perfection, as that there will be few or no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites therein; and if but a few, the power in effect, will be in the hands of the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> notwithſtanding, by reaſon of their number.</p>
                  <p>What perfection the Church in thoſe daies ſhall be brought unto, is held forth in ſundry places. As for inſtance, <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. 21. the Prophet ſpeaking of thoſe times, as appeareth by <hi>Eſay</hi> 59. 20, 21. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. ſaith, <hi>Thy ſunne ſhall no more goe down, for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and the daies of thy mourning ſhall be ended; thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous, and they ſhall inherit the Land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified; I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi> Till that time come, it is not to be expected. So, Eſay 35. 8. <hi>An high way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſſe; the unclean ſhall not paſſe over it, no Lion ſhall be there, nor any ravenous beaſt ſhall goe up thereon, it ſhall not be found there; but the redeemed ſhall walke there, and the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Zion with ſongs and everlaſting joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</hi> This
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118924:67"/> promiſe is reduced to Gods <hi>Covenant with Abraham,</hi> concerning his <hi>bleſſing and encreaſing his ſeed, Eſai.</hi> 51. 1, 2, 3. 11. And of the ſame times is that ſpoken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. when it is ſaid, <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes.</hi> v. 4. <hi>And the City had no need of the Sun, for the glory of the Lord did lighten it.</hi> v. 23. &amp; v. 27. is added, <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lye: but they which are written in the Lambs Book of life.</hi> So Rev. 22. 14, 15. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City; for without are Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and whatſoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi> Zach. 14. 21. <hi>In that day every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and in</hi> Judah, <hi>ſhall be holineſſe unto the Lord of Hoſts, and in that day there ſhall be no more the</hi> Canaanite <hi>in the houſe of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe places I determine not an abſolute perfection in the Church then, or an exemption from all Hypocriſie, but a far greater meaſure of Purity then as yet is attained to I may; and I may adde, to what degree ſoever of purity and perfection in the Church the meaning of thoſe expreſſions is to be extended leſſe or more, it is evident, that untill the Church be come to that ripeneſs and glory, yea even ſuch as may deſerve that title of the new <hi>Jeruſalem which cometh down from Heaven, wherein righteouſneſs ſhal dwel,</hi> the people of God may not expect to poſſeſs that power. The truth is, ſhould ſuch power be put upon them now as things are, in that condition wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of God is at preſent, there would ſo many put on viſards of Hypocriſie and ſeeming Saintſhip to get into place, as but very few of the true <hi>ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham</hi> ſhould obtaine it; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118924:68"/> ſuch diſſemblers and pretenders being in place would act very much unlike to Saints, and ſo much the worſe by how much the more they are refined in profeſſion and the outſide of religion, being falſe and rotten ſtill within. Therefore as the Lord hath deſigned ſuch a power even in this world unto his people, ſo he hath reſerved it untill ſuch time as they ſhall be in a fit capacity to receive and uſe it, as he ſaith <hi>Eſai.</hi> 60. 22. <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, that notwithſtanding this objection, the promiſe of ſuch power is intended unto ſuch as are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed indeed, not to thoſe who are pretenders only to be ſuch, ſo as when that day comes, as it ſhall naturally fall upon them, ſo there will be no cauſe of grief to people that power is ſo placed as it will then be.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this uſe, I muſt adde a word by way of caution, leaſt I be miſtaken in that which hath been ſaid; namely this, That in the mean ſeaſon, till this <hi>new Jeruſalem be come down from Heaven,</hi> it is not to be ſuppoſed that the people of God ſhould lay aſide their ſwords, or not to ſhare among others in the power of Common-wealths, and not be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and that above others too ſometimes, in carrying on the work of God in the world, in order to the encreaſe of his Kingdome, and that by force too, ſo far as it is capable to be uſed to advance that work. But as when the whole power ſhall be put into their hands according to the propheſies menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, it ſhall naturally be divolved or caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and become theirs according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rules of juſtice, from principles of nature and reaſon, as hath been ſhewed; ſo much leſſe in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118924:68"/> mean time in being ſerviceable to their Country, ſhall they act in any other capacity then as good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths men, and as being involved in the ſame common intereſt with others of that nation or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof they are a part. Their <hi>Saintſhip</hi> may fit them for their truſt, and in elections may beſpeak them to it by way of merit, but not entitle them to any place or power in Common-wealths. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is not of this world,</hi> nor ever ſhall be, as was ſhewed before in opening of the point.</p>
                  <p>Should the power and government be entitled to <hi>Saints</hi> as ſuch, we had need be in a better capacity to know them, and to ſay which are <hi>Saints,</hi> which not, then indeed we are. Therefore to ſalve that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, thoſe who have pretended that priviledge and acted thereupon, have accordingly ordered their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires by pretended Revelations from Heaven; which practice how abſurd it is, and what a monſter in a Common-wealth, is obvious to any underſtanding that will but conſider, that acts of juſtice in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth are to be of publique cogniſance, and ſuch as are ſuppoſed to be owned, or ought to be, by the community, or the major part thereof, for which cauſe a Revelation from Heaven brought in evidence in any court, although it ſhould be true, is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence for any Judge to go upon in paſſing ſentence, becauſe unleſſe the Judge have a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, it comes not within his underſtanding to be able to judge of the matter. If both Judge and Witneſſes have a Revelation ſpeaking the ſame thing, yet he may not paſſe the ſentence thereupon, becauſe the ſentence of the Court is ſuppoſed to be the vote of the Common-wealth: therefore the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even all the power thereof, if need be, is engaged
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118924:69"/> to put the ſentence in execution. And for this purpoſe it may be pertinently conſidered, whether that was not one cauſe why <hi>Cain</hi> was not to be put to death for his murder, becauſe having done it ſecretly <hi>in the field,</hi> it was not revealed but by the Lord himſelfe: for what cometh within the cogniſance of any Civil Court, of matters criminal to be puniſhed, muſt be within the compaſſe of ſenſe or reaſon.</p>

                  <p>One thing more concerning this matter I ſhal adde, which is a ſeventh Uſe to be made of this point, Namely, that thoſe who are the people of God doe learn from thence, what courſe is to be taken by them to advance this <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By that which hath been ſaid we clearly ſee, the courſe they are to take is to endeavour what they can to increaſe the number of his people. And in order thereunto that they labour to be bleſſings to their Families, and to the Nation and places where they live; to be a meanes to ſeaſon the hearts of their little ones, ſervants, friends, and neighbours, with the knowledge and love of Chriſt. And though the work is great, and far beyond our own abilities, or all that we can do by inſtruction or example, ſhould the Lord withdraw his powerful aſſiſtance, yet we muſt know that God is able, who hath promiſed to make beleevers bleſſings to Families and Nations, and by multiplying them to cauſe them to poſſeſſe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies gate. Now for this end that you may be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in this manner,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, take heed you break not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as thoſe perſons do who deny the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeal thereof to Infants, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and thereby as much as lieth in them do nullifie and make void that promiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118924:69"/> in defence of that miſtake it is often ſeen, that they deny that promiſe to be of ſuch extent.</p>
                  <p>Far be it from me to ſay or think, that none of that beleef eare bleſſings to Families or Nations. Many of them I beleeve are holy and ſincere, and very deare to Chriſt, who knoweth how to paſſe by the errours and infirmities of his people, and maketh even ſuch, notwithſtanding that miſtake, inſtruments of much good to both. But this I may affirme from what hath been ſaid in this point, that thoſe who thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid little Children to be brought to Chriſt, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is pretended, are in that thing but ſmall friends to his <hi>Kingdome;</hi> and in that particular, an ill way it is they take, in order to their being <hi>bleſſings, either to families or nations.</hi> The right way of increaſing that Kingdome, and of exalting his throne and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the world being waved and neglected, other ways which are unnatural, unſafe, and falſe, are quickly taken up, and ſo the iſſue is according; and in ſtead of ſetting up his Kingdome, ere they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, they are ready to ſet up ſomething elſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that I ſay, no more, no bleſſing is to be expected.</p>
                  <p>It is the bleſſing of God upon perſons, not their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities how great ſoever, whereby they are made active in being bleſſings unto any, chiefly in managing affaires of his Kingdome, which is a bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And we ſee that he conferreth bleſſings ſtill according to his covenant, as all that he hath ever done, or doth for any of his people, hath ever been and is according to a covenant. And however we are apt to think that an omiſſion of an ordinance or duty therein required makes no great matter, yet he putteth much upon it and proceeds accordingly as he ſees fit in giving and denying of his bleſſing, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118924:70"/> in leaving marks of his diſpleaſure upon ſuch as doe tranſgreſſe therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As you would be <hi>bleſſings to Families and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as you are to have that priviledge by vertue of <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> ſo you muſt <hi>follow Abrahams ſteps. Be not ſlothful</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the words next before my Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes. If ye were Abrahams children,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 39. (that is, ſo as to inherit <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for otherwiſe they were his natural ſeed) <hi>ye would do the works of Abraham.</hi> Think not therefore to be bleſſings to your neighbours, or to your owne children, or ſervants, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, unleſſe you follow his ſteps: And that in three things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt teach your Families as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>I know him,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgement, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> Implying that if family-duties be neglected, notwithſtanding the promiſe, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing will not take effect. God carries on his work of ſanctification ſo as to take his people into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf therein, and to make them active in the work: therefore he conferrs his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of that nature upon us by the uſe of means, and they ſuch as are fitteſt, and moſt natural, and proper to bring his work to paſſe. Among all the means of grace there is none more effectual then family-inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and example; by means hereof are perſons fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared for, &amp; made more capable of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by publique preaching, the younger ſort eſpecially.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118924:70"/> Hereby the parents or family-governours authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, example, and intereſt is improved to a very great advantage, to cauſe attention, wakefulneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, readineſſe to hear, to read, to ponder and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the truth revealed in the Goſpel. That reſpect and love which uſually is mutual in ſuch relations, is of mighty force to make endeavors of this nature hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and ſuccesful. The Lord knew this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not loſe it; therefore hath he promiſed to water ſuch endeavours with the dew of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He loveth there to bleſſe, where there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be bleſſed by him. <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 12. &amp; 25. 29.</note> Knowing therefore of what uſe his Saints might be, to bring in others to himſelf, eſpecially thoſe under their power, guidance, and tuition, he hath therefore promiſed to make beleevers bleſſings unto families kindreds and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon this account it was, that <hi>Joſhuah</hi> could undertake not only for himſelf, but alſo for his houſe. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>Chuſe ye whom ye will ſerve, but as for mee and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Thus we read that <hi>Timothy knew the Scriptures from a Child.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. And this becauſe <hi>the ſame faith dwelt in him, which dwelt firſt in his Grand-Mother</hi> Lois, <hi>and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Eunice. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. We read alſo, how the wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> was inſtructed by his Mother. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is your way to encreaſe the <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt.</hi> And yet this is not all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing wherein you are to follow <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſteps, is uprightneſs and ſingleneſs of heart in what you do for God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me and be thou upright, and I will make my covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee; and I will multiply thee exceedingly.</hi> So Pſal. 112. 2. <hi>The generation of the upright ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> A great part of a Chriſtians work in his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118924:71"/> with God, lieth in family-duties. Now if he be but formal in it, taking up a form of Godlineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loveth to ſeem religious, although he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in duties of all ſorts, albeit a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is better then nothing, yet little good is done in ſuch a caſe. He that in ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart, ſets himſelfe to glorifie God, and to ſave the ſouls of ſuch as are about him, he it is that is a bleſſing where he liveth. Such uprightneſſe of heart engageth his affections in the work, therefore what counſel or inſtruction he adminiſters, or what exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he giveth, taketh more impreſſion. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the heart goeth to the heart; and there it fixeth with more authority and power. A formal Chriſtian is like <hi>unſavory ſalt</hi> that ſeaſons not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You muſt not ſatisfie your ſelves with this, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> muſt be followed yet one ſtep further. You muſt labour to be <hi>friends of God</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was: <note place="margin">James. 2. 23.</note> that is, you muſt be ſpiritual and heavenly Chriſtians, walking cloſe with God, no ſtrangers to him, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving narrowly his carriage towards you, applying your ſelves to pleaſe him in all things, to gaine upon his love, to encreaſe in favour with him. Such as keep acquaintance dayly and converſe with God, ſuch perſons alwaies are a bleſſing where they live. As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>they are like leaven</hi> apt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuch as are about them with the fear and love of Chriſt. He that converſeth much with God, hath an humble, meek and ſavory ſpirit; He is rich in faith, much of God appeareth ſtill in all his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; His preſence therefore and example is a check to wickedneſs, a provocation and encouragement to holineſs of life. As a friend of the Bridgroome, he is a bleſſed meanes to bring many ſoules into the arms
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118924:71"/> of Chriſt. On the other ſide, whoever he be that neglecteth this friendſhip, is in very ſmall capacity to be an inſtrument of ſpiritual good to any; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who are neareſt to him, who moſt obſerve his wayes, and ſee into his actions. <hi>A friend of the Bridegroome and the Bride muſt be a friend of God.</hi>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:118924:74"/>
               <p>The words thus opened offer to us many things by way of obſervation; I ſhall onely ſpeak to thoſe three particulars wherein the manifeſtations of God to them and us doe differ. The firſt whereof and the third I ſhall put together in one concluſion, which I ſhall inſiſt upon; in handling whereof, I ſhall alſo touch upon the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion or point of doctrin is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That, However in the times before Chriſt, God ſpake to the Fathers by Prophets extraordinarily inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and by divers waies of Revelation: yet to us in theſe laſt daies, thoſe extraordinary waies, and ſuch Prophets are ceaſed; and he hath ſpoken to us onely by his ſon; what elſe is to be attained to, in the manifeſtations of God to us, is onely by the uſe of ordinary gifts, in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the mind of God from what the Sonne hath ſpoken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling whereof, ſomething muſt firſt be done yet further by way of explication, and ſo the queſtion will be this, What the Apoſtle meanes by ſpeaking, <hi>He ſpake by the Prophets, and hath ſpoken by his Sonne?</hi> To which I anſwer, That we are not to confine it onely to a literall ſpeaking by a voyce, <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 8.</note> becauſe the Prophets ſometimes ſpake by ſignes, and the Sonne ſpake not onely by words, but alſo by actions; therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>his blood ſpeaketh,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. And by a voyce the Sonne ſpake but to a few, in the daies of his converſing with us in the fleſh; but this his ſpeaking in the Text is to us alſo <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> as was ſhewed before; therefore by his ſpeaking by the Prophets, we are to underſtand the whole manifeſtation of God, which he gave unto his Saints by them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or otherwiſe, left upon record in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118924:75"/> books of the Old Teſtament. And by his ſpeaking by his Sonne the whole manifeſtation of God by Jeſus Chriſt, and that not onely in words but in his actions alſo, his incarnation, death, reſurrection, aſcention into glory, even his whole work in the office of his Mediatourſhip, upon record, and unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the writings of the New Teſtament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſayes the work of his Miniſtry was, <hi>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Therefore what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did in their Miniſtry, was part of this his ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>by his Sonne;</hi> for they gave forth no light into the world but in <hi>his face,</hi> which is not meant of his naturall <hi>face,</hi> for he was now aſcended, but by <hi>face</hi> is meant the whole draught, or ſtory of Chriſt, as it is ſet forth in the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Therefore alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his preaching was <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. and the ſumme of all that we learn in the Goſpel <hi>is Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 20. <hi>Ye have not ſo learned Christ.</hi> By all which appears, that this his ſpeaking by his Sonne, is not only by a voyce, but by words and deeds both, as they are ſet forth to us in the writings of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo if it be objected, that even in the times of his ſpeaking by his Sonne, thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ways of revelation have been in uſe, becauſe the Apoſtles had them; the anſwer is ready, that what was done by the Apoſtles and Prophets in the Primitive times, was his very <hi>ſpeaking by his Sonne,</hi> it was the meanes whereby the Sonne hath given out that word or manifeſtation of God which he had to ſpeak; and when the Apoſtle here oppoſeth this his ſpeaking by his Sonne to thoſe extraordinary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118924:75"/> wayes by Prophets in former times, the meaning is not that the Sonnes ſpeaking was not extraordinary, but that being diſpatcht and finiſht, (which was done when what the Sonne had manifeſted was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by thoſe Witneſſes,</hi> choſen of God, fitted and atteſted by <hi>miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, Heb.</hi> 2. 3. 4.) that afterwards thoſe waies of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould not be in uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> It will be ſaid, If ſpeaking by Apoſtles and Meſſengers be a ſpeaking by the Sonne, why was it not a ſpeaking alſo by the Sonne before his coming in the fleſh, when he ſpake by Prophets, eſpecially ſince thoſe Prophets of old were alſo the Meſſengers of Chriſt; for he that gave the <hi>New Teſtament and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by his blood, Heb.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>gave alſo the Old, Heb.</hi> 8. 8. And it was the ſpirit of Chriſt which ſpake in thoſe Prophets, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>The Prophets ſearched what manner of time the ſpirit of Chriſt which was in them, did ſignifie; by which ſpirit alſo he preached to thoſe who were diſobedient in the daies of Noah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, that it is true, the ſpirit of Chriſt ſpake in them, and they were ſent by Chriſt the Son of God, but the Sonne was not then made known as now he is; therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that God did <hi>chuſe him to reveale his Sonne in him or by him, Gal.</hi> 1. 16. And the Evangeliſt ſpeaking of the Word, or Sonne of God, ſaith of thoſe times, <hi>the light ſhone in darkneſſe, and the darkneſſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not. Joh.</hi> 1. 5. therefore alſo the meſſage was not then delivered in the Sonnes name, as now it is, <hi>We as Ambaſſadours for Chriſt beſeech you.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. therefore though he ſpake in thoſe Prophets, yet that was not this ſpeaking by the Sonne.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:118924:76"/>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe then he ſpake onely by Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, now he came himſelf and ſpake; and the manifeſtation of God by him, was not more by what he ſaid, then by what he was, and did; and though by Meſſengers ſtill, yet their work was onely to lay open, and make out to us that manifeſtation of God which was given by the Sons coming, and by what he ſaid and did. The worke of the Prophets then was to declare what the ſpirit of Chriſt revealed to them; but the work of the Apoſtles, and other Pen-men of the New Teſtament, was to ſet forth and unfold what Chriſt himſelfe, in the whole work of Redemption, had ſaid and done, which the Apoſtle cals <hi>a revealing of the Son by him,</hi> and <hi>a preaching Chriſt crucified, and a giving the knowledg of the glory of God in his face;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 23. 2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though this is done in ſome part by Meſſengers, yet is it called a ſpeaking by the Sonne, the other not. Which Objection being anſwered, we may conclude, that this his ſpeaking by his Sonne, takes in all the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in which the words and workes of Chriſt are ſet forth, either by way of Hiſtory, as in the Evangeliſts, or of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as in the Epiſtles, or of Propheſie, as in the Revelation. And I muſt adde, that it contains alſo the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, becauſe <hi>he came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and becauſe what was ſpoken by the Prophets darkly, was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken over again by the Sonne with greater light, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that uſual ſaying, <hi>The New Teſtament was vailed in the Old, the Old revealed in the New.</hi> So as the ſumme of the point is this, that what we have in Scripture manifeſted of God, is all we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of extraordinary revelations; what elſe is to be done in Gods diſcovery of himſelf and his truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118924:76"/> us, is to be had in the uſe of ordinary gifts, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſearching out the mind of God from what the Sonne hath ſpoken in them.</p>
               <p>For a confirmation of this truth ſomething is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be obſerved from thoſe words in the Text, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in theſe laſt dayes:</hi> which words imply that there were certain periods of time foregoing; there is at leaſt a firſt and a ſecond, where there is a laſt. Take one from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>end of the World</hi> is the laſt. Now what is it which makes theſe diſtinct periods of time? namely, the ſeveral degrees of <hi>Gods manifeſting himſelf</hi> to the Sons of men; now therefore becauſe ours is the laſt, we are to expect no other ſuch manifeſtations of God, but what we have received by this his ſpeaking by his Sonne, as we have it in the Text, <hi>In theſe laſt daies he hath ſpoken to us by his Sonne.</hi> To this may be added that in the Parable, when meſſengers were ſent, <hi>at laſt he ſent his Sonne,</hi> and after him none, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 37. And it is ſaid, that he reveals unto us all the Fathers mind: <hi>All that I have heard of the Father, have I declared unto you.</hi> Joh. 15. 15. and <hi>none hath ſeen God at any time; the onely begotten Sonne, who is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A further evidence of this truth we have yet in the Text, from that ſecond note of difference men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in opening the words, namely, <hi>that however by thoſe Prophets to them he ſpake piece after piece,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>at ſundry times,</hi> yet <hi>to us, by</hi> that one Prophet <hi>his Sonne, he hath ſpoken</hi> all that he had to ſay at once, and laid open the whole <hi>myſtery of his will.</hi> Eph. 1. 9. <hi>That which was hid from ages and generations, but now is made manifeſt unto his Saints, Col.</hi> 1. 26. So as more
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118924:77"/> cannot be done, in opening all the ſecrets of his love, the heights and depths of the mercy, goodneſſe, and wiſdome of the father, then what the ſonne hath done; and we may ſay with <hi>Solomon</hi> in this, <hi>what can the man do that cometh after the King? even that which is already done.</hi> Therefore more then what is done by the Sonnes ſpeaking, is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe is that in <hi>Jude</hi> 13. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bids us to <hi>contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2. 12.</note> once delivered, that is, ſo as it was fully done, to which nothing ſhould be added, ſo as we ſhould expect no more ſuch delivering of the faith; therefore in caſe any of it were loſt by any, or in hazard, as ſome did then <hi>make Shipwrack of the faith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> he ſaith not that they ſhould contend for more revelations, whereby to be eſtabliſhed in the truth, but ſhould contend for what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. So the word <hi>once</hi> is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Chriſt was once offered to beare the ſinnes of many;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>through the offering of the body of Chriſt once;</hi> and Heb. 7. 27. <hi>who needeth not dayly, as thoſe high Priests, to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſinnes, and then for the peoples; for this he did once, when he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;</hi> that is, he did it ſo as there needed no more ſacrifice for ſinne, becauſe it was a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſacrifice, ſuch as would do the work. He did more by his one ſacrifice <hi>once offered,</hi> then was done by all the many ſorts of ſacrifices before him; ſo he did more by his one manifeſtation once made, then all the Prophets before him had done in all times, by their ſeveral ways of revelation. Now therfore I ſay, this being ſo that the manifeſtations of God are no more <hi>by pieces,</hi> but all given forth at <hi>once,</hi> there is no
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118924:77"/> ther waies to be expected beſides this his <hi>ſpeaking to us by his Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another proofe of this point we have, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>When the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeake of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak, and he ſhal ſhew you things to come; he ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall take of mine and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> In which words we have the work of the ſpirit, what and in what manner it ſhould be in the Saints after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt; for he ſpake this to his Diſciples as beleevers, not as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles onely, his ſcope being to comfort them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his departure from them; <hi>Becauſe I have ſaid theſe things to you</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſorrow hath filled your hearts, but it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſinne, of righteouſneſſe, and of judgement;</hi> and not onely ſo, <hi>he ſhal lead you into all truth,</hi> &amp;c. all which are things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to beleevers, and not a word doth he ſpeak of their Apoſtleſhip in that place; therefore I ſay the words do ſet forth the work of the ſpirit in the Saints, what it ſhould be after his departure from them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the worlds end: So as if any extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are now to be expected, we are likelieſt to finde them here; becauſe if any be, they muſt be from the ſpirit; conſider therefore what he ſaith in this place; <hi>He ſhall guide or lead you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into all truth,</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118924:78"/> revelation give or bring a new Doctrine of his own, that Chriſt had not before revealed, but his work ſhould be to build upon his foundation, and what he hath heard revealed or ſpoken by the Son, the Spirit ſhould demonſtrate to them, and make them underſtand; therefore he addes, <hi>He ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me, for he ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you.</hi> The Spirit puts this honour upon Chriſt, that look what he hath ſpoken or revealed, that he takes and ſhewes it unto us, and onely that. The Spirit never ſteps aſide from the Scripture, or from what the Sonne hath ſpoken, to ſhew or teach us any thing whatſoever; all the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is in the face of Chriſt. The Sonnes work was Revelation, the Spirits work is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; as he ſayes here, <hi>he ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you:</hi> So the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>his preaching was in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and <hi>by the hearing of faith</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 3. 2. that is the way wherein the ſpirit of God breaks in, and works upon us, not by viſions or extraordinary revelations as in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old time.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, that the meaning is not, that Chriſt had not revealed the whole myſtery of his Fathers will; for he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>All things that I have heard of the Father I have made known unto you.</hi> But that concerning what he had declared he had
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118924:78"/> more to ſay, for a more particular and fuller under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, which he would performe by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit after his Aſcenſion; therefore he ſaith that this the ſpirit ſhould do, not by <hi>ſpeaking of himſelfe, but by taking of the things of Chriſt and ſhewing them unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer further, that the Sons ſpeaking in the Text implyes more then is intended <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 12. where he ſaith, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay,</hi> for this he intends onely of what in words he had ſaid unto them; but in the Text by the Sonnes ſpeaking is meant (as hath been ſhewed) the whole Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in Chriſt, whether in words or actions; therefore though it be granted that in words he had not ſpoken ſomething which the ſpirit ſhould ſhew unto them, yet in his whole manifeſtation in words and actions put together you have the whole matter which the Spirit was to ſhew.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> To this I anſwer that we find the like affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all beleevers, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking to all ſorts of Chriſtians, under the names of <hi>Fathers, Young Men, and Little Children,</hi> (v. 13.) ſaith, <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things.</hi> Which is not ſo to be underſtood as if theſe little Children, though they had the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, had nothing hid from their knowledge, for then what needed the Apoſtle to write to them, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe who did ſeduce them,</hi> v. 26? nor can it be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118924:79"/> ſaid of the Apoſtles themſelves, that they were ſo led into all truth as that no truth was unknown to them; the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>we know in part;</hi> therefore that is not the meaning; but that it is the property and office of the ſpirit to lead us into truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one truth as well as another, and that all truth at laſt the Church ſhall be led into by the Spirit, and that ſo far as we are led by the ſpirit, we are led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth, which being but in part, we <hi>know but in part</hi> in this life. <hi>As for his ſhewing things to come,</hi> that alſo is meant of all beleevers, who by what the Son hath revealed are put into a capacity, by ſearch of the Scriptures, to underſtand propheſies, which were things <hi>ſealed up</hi> before even from the Saints, which the Spirit enables us to do alſo by <hi>taking of the things of Chriſt, and ſhewing them unto us:</hi> Therefore is it ſaid (<hi>Rev.</hi> 5. &amp; 6.) that <hi>the Lamb that was ſlain took the book</hi> of propheſies, <hi>and opened the ſeales thereof;</hi> By fulfilling the propheſies as to his owne perſon, he makes the Saints of theſe laſt dayes able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them alſo as to his Church or myſtical body. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the ſeales thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, and haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts.</hi> And this the voice both of the <hi>foure living Creatures, and of the four and twenty Elders,</hi> even of the whole Church and company of beleevers.</p>
               <p>Another Teſtimony to this Doctrine we have <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God alſo bearing them witneſs both with ſigns &amp; wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own will?</hi> Where we ſee the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118924:79"/> is the Sonnes the Lord Chriſt, and the work of the Apoſtles was to be but Witneſſes and Confirmers of it to us, for which they were fitted with power of miracles and other gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which being done, the work and office of the Apoſtles was ended, and of no further uſe but by their Writings, unleſſe we can ſuppoſe that what the Sonne hath ſpoken needs a further Witneſſe, or confirmation to our faith. Therefore alſo Chriſt is ſaid to be the <hi>Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, Heb.</hi> 3. 1. becauſe our whole direction in Religion is what he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us.</p>
               <p>Thus having found this to be a truth, the next thing to be conſidered, is, how it comes to paſſe, or what reaſon can be given, ſince the Lord hath the ſame <hi>abundance of ſpirit,</hi> and could as eaſily ſpeak to us by dreams, viſions and revelations extraordinary, and by perſons infallibly inſpired, now as ever, his people alſo as dear and precious to him, why he ſhould now deny his people that which formerly he granted, and leave them onely to what he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his Sonne, to find out the mind of God and the myſtery of his will only by the uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ordinary gifts. Among other reaſons that might be given of this I ſhall mention three.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</label> Becauſe this his ſpeaking by his Sonne hath brought into the world a greater light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thoſe wayes of revelation are made uſeleſſe and unprofitable; as when the Sunne ariſeth, all the Starres are out of ſight. Chriſt is the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, who ſince his riſing hath put the Saints into a better ſtate, then to ſtand in need of ſuch waies of light which were in the world before. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>The darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth.</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:118924:80"/> It is true that in the time of the Churches infancy, under the law, the Saints needed ſuch diſpenſations and they had them; but ſince his ſpeaking to us by his Sonne, the Church is no more as a child under age, and it needs them not; the reaſon is, becauſe by his ſpeaking to to by his Sonne, the Saints are in a better capacity of finding out the minde of God, by induſtry and labour, in the uſe of ordinary gifts, by ſearch and ſtudy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe the whole myſterie of his will is now revealed; for where there is the whole truth diſcovered in any matter, each part will beare witneſſe, and give illuſtration to the other, which was not ſo in the times before Chriſt; they had truth, but not the whole truth layd open; that is the meaning of that place, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. <hi>The Law was given by Moſes, but truth was by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> not that the Law was not truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 142. <hi>Thy law is the truth:</hi> but it was the truth under types and ſhadows, ſo as much of it was then hidden, which now is made manifeſt: <hi>The myſtery kept hid from ages and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> was revealed by Jeſus Chriſt. The Law ſhews the order, but the power is diſcovered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the Law telleth us of <hi>life in God in the wayes of his ſervice,</hi> but it leaves us to ask ſuch queſtions, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven, or deſcend down into the deep,</hi> and how ſhall this or that be? the Goſpel anſwers all theſe queſtions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8. When a man hath not the whole of a matter before him, he cannot ſee farre into it, or make a full judgement of it. This was the caſe before Chriſt, therefore they had need of ſuch Prophets, and ſuch wayes of revelation which are uſeleſſe now. Therefore alſo the Apoſtle ſaith in oppoſition to thoſe times, that <hi>We all with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118924:80"/> open face behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord.</hi> And ſo we are to underſtand our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11. concerning <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>he was greater then all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before him, and the leaſt in the Kingdom of God greater then he,</hi> It is not meant of <hi>Johns</hi> perſonall gifts or graces, for ſo he was beyond many in the Kingdom of God; but of the ſtate of things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as they ſtood then and afterwards, in reſpect of <hi>knowing the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the myſtery of his will.</hi> The Prophets did not ſo fully underſtand what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves propheſyed, as now they are underſtood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. And indeed this is one main thing intended in Gods ſpeaking by his Sonne, a bringing down of the knowledge of God to the underſtandings of the ſonnes of men to the loweſt condeſcention. This work is full of difficulty; God therefore condeſcends, and findes out wayes to doe it by degrees; now when <hi>he ſpake to us by his Sonne,</hi> he did as much as could be done therein. <hi>No man knoweth who the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale him.</hi> Luke 10. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</label> Becauſe by ſpeaking to us by his Sonne, he hath alſo put us into a capacity of attaining to as neere communion with God in the viſions of his glory, and revelations of his love to us, in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, as they attain'd unto by thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes of ſpeaking to them; and however thoſe wayes are ceaſed, yet we (in a right ſenſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) are not without <hi>the viſions and revelations of</hi> the Lord.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe by means of that glorious <hi>manifeſtation,</hi> which God hath made of himſelfe <hi>by his Sonne,</hi> all the Saints of the New Teſtament have a more plentifull participation of the Spirit of God,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118924:81"/> then formerly was had. <hi>John</hi> 7. 38. <hi>He that believeth in me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living waters. This he ſpake</hi> (ſayes the Evangeliſt) <hi>of the ſpirit, which thoſe who believe in him ſhould receive; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſpirit was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet glorified;</hi> ſo as ſuch giving of the ſpirit was to be an effect of the ſhining forth of his glory among his people; which is as much as to ſay it is a fruit of <hi>Gods ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to us by his Sonne.</hi> The ſpirit ſtayed untill that <hi>light and glory did appeare.</hi> The ſpirit of God is <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> accordingly he worketh like himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. and 16. 13. therefore when the whole myſterie of the truth of the Goſpel was revealed by Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, then was the ſeaſon of this more plentifull pouring forth of the Spirit of God upon his people. The Spirit was given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but not in ſuch a meaſure or degree as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſometimes ſpeaketh of a new degree as of a new thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>God ſent his Sonne to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons;</hi> yet they had received the adoption of Sons before, in the times of the Old Teſtament; <hi>To whom pertaineth the adoption,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. And <hi>Iſrael was his firſt-born, Exod.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. but the priviledge thereof the people of God in the <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Church</hi> had not received in that degree as afterwards they did, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 1. And yet at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſuch a farther degree is ſpoken of to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, as if we had not yet received the adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Waiting for the adoption, the redemption of the body.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the latter ſo exceeds in glory that which was before; as the Apoſtle
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118924:81"/> ſpeaks concerning the differing glory of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Old Teſtament and the New; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory which excelleth.</hi> Thus alſo, and for the ſame reaſon, though he ſpeaks but of another degree or meaſure of giving the ſpirit, he ſpeaks of it as if it had not been at all given before.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit was plentifully given before to the Prophets extraordinarily inſpired, but now it is ſo given to all believers, although in another way, at leaſt it is a priviledge belonging to them, however by too many it is ſo much neglected. Therefore is it made an appurtenance to our adoption, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba father.</hi> Again, <hi>becauſe ye are Sonnes, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Sonne into your hearts. Gal.</hi> 4. 5.) Becauſe it is a gift beſtowed upon all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20. the Apoſtle ſaith not onely that the <hi>fathers,</hi> or <hi>young men,</hi> but alſo even the <hi>little children,</hi> under which three names he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth believers of all ſorts, had <hi>received the unction of the holy one, and knew all things.</hi> And to all the Saints in the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>by the hearing of faith they had received the ſpirit. Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Therefore the officers or miniſters of the Church, and preachers of the Word, who alſo are <hi>miniſters not of the letter, but of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. are men of the ſame gifts as others are, ſubject alſo to errour as others are, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. That prophecying which we muſt not deſpiſe, as we would not quench the ſpirit, the Apoſtle ſaith we muſt ſuppoſe may bring us ſomething that is not good. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit, deſpiſe not prophecying,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118924:82"/> prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called <hi>Elders,</hi> becauſe however their Function is ſacred, yet their gifts are the ſame with other Chriſtians, and differ not in kind, but onely in degree; choſen therefore by Chriſtians from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And for a further proofe and illuſtration of this truth, we may obſerve that the ordinary preaching of the word by ſuch perſons ſo gifted, whether El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or others allowed by the Church to preach the word, is there called <hi>prophecying, Deſpiſe not prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> As alſo it is called by that name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And as the Preachers are called <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſo what proviſion they by ſtudy &amp; labour have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the people, is called <hi>a revelation,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 29. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three,</hi> viz. onely ſo many at one meeting, <hi>and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth, let the firſt hold his peace; for ye may all prophecy one by one, that ye may all learne, and all may be comforted; and the ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the Prophets; for God is not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confuſion, but of peace.</hi> In all this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ordinary preaching; Firſt, becauſe it was ſuch wherein the <hi>women might not ſpeak in the Churches.</hi> V. 34. As for women that were Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes extraordinarily inſpir'd, they might ſpeake therein. Therefore that was one thing for which <hi>Thyatira</hi> was blamed, namely, for <hi>ſuffering the woman Jezabel to teach, who called her ſelfe a Propheteſſe,</hi> and was not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 20. And it is ſaid that <hi>Philip had foure daughters that did prophecy, Acts</hi> 21. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe we cannot ſuppoſe that a revelation received from God by a Prophet extraordinarily inſpired, could runne him upon extravagancies, or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118924:82"/> upon that which made confuſion in the Church, ſo as the Apoſtle ſhould need to tell them that two perſons muſt not ſpeak together at once. And alſo becauſe he ſaith, <hi>the ſpirits of ſuch Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe words, <hi>If any thing be revealed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſits by, let the firſt hold his peace;</hi> although they are alledged by ſome to prove the contrary, yet being well conſidered, it will appear alſo even from thoſe words themſelves, that they are rather to be meant of ſomething which he had provided to ſpeak before he came into the Congregation, then of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den extraordinary revelation. I confeſſe as the words are tranſlated, they ſound ſomething the other way: the word, <hi>by,</hi> is not in the Greek, and we are to read them thus, <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <hi>that ſitteth by.</hi> It is not the Apoſtles ſcope onely to expreſſe the poſture of the man; for whether he ſate or ſtood, if he had a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he was to have the ſame liberty of ſpeaking. Nor is it his ſcope onely to ſet forth his being <hi>by,</hi> or preſent in the Congregation; for then he had rather ſaid, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; But a further matter is intended, as we may ſee by the ſame phraſe uſed <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Paul and Barnabas,</hi> at their firſt comming to <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia, went into the Synagogue on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and</hi> (ſays the Text) <hi>they ſat,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: In which words alſo the holy Ghoſt intends more then barely to record their poſture in the Synagogue, or to ſet it down whether they ſat or ſtood. It is a phraſe, both in this place and in the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. importing thus much, a placing themſelves ſo in the Congregation, as therby giving notice to them that they had ſomething to ſpeak unto the people;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118924:83"/> as appears in that <hi>the rulers of the Synagogue, after the Lecture of the Law was ended,</hi> applyed themſelvs to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> without any ſpeech had with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereby to have known their minds, ſaying, <hi>Men and brethren, if ye have a word of exhortation to the people, ſpeak.</hi> Whether it was becauſe the Sonnes of the Prophets in <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not fixed in one place, for the exerciſe of their function, but went occaſionally from place to place propheſying in the Synagogues, or what elſe was the cauſe, it ſeemes that in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues there was a place provided on purpoſe, in which whoever placed himſelf, the people expected ſome word of God from them; and thoſe who would tender themſelves to ſpeak, did purpoſely ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that ſeat: ſome ſuch cuſtome I ſuppoſe it was that occaſioned this phraſe; and ſo you are to underſtand that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and this in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth,</hi> that is, to another that is provided and tenders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſpeak; in ſuch a caſe (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>he that ſpeaks firſt is to take but ſo much time as to leave room for him who is to follow.</hi> Thus we ſee, that thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words do point us rather to the <hi>ordinary proviſion</hi> of the preachers of the word <hi>by ordinary gifts,</hi> and to ſomething whereof they are ſuppoſed to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>meditation and ſtudy,</hi> before they come into the Congregation, then to any <hi>extemporary revelation.</hi> And it is evident from thoſe reaſons given before, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch, and that as the Preacher is called <hi>a Prophet,</hi> ſo ſuch proviſion is there called <hi>a revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I may adde, what we have found and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered from <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 18. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. in the former Treatiſe upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

Now by that ſpeech of the Angel, whoever hath this <hi>Teſtimonie,</hi> (which is the character and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of every beleever in the times of the New Teſtament, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. &amp; 1. 9. &amp; 6. 9.) hath the <hi>Spirit of propheſie,</hi> and is therefore a <hi>fellow-ſervant</hi> to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel by whom the Lord Chriſt gave the revelation of ſuch propheſies unto his ſervant <hi>John.</hi> The reaſon is becauſe whoever hath the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> hath it not onely in the Letter, but hath received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>The miniſtration of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, that <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of Propheſie,</hi> becauſe it is not had without the Spirit.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118924:84"/> 
                  <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 12. 3. It is a <hi>living word, if it be an abiding word</hi> in any ſoule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
               <p>By all which places we ſee that we in the times of the New Teſtament are not without the <hi>Revelations of God;</hi> and that in an ordinary way, by the uſe of ordinary gifts, we have in effect the ſame communion with God, in the <hi>viſions of his glory</hi> and the diſcovery of his fatherly affection to us, as they had by thoſe extraordinary wayes of Revelation.</p>
               <p>This therefore is another reaſon of the point; namely why thoſe extraordinary wayes are ceaſed, and that what is attained of the <hi>manifeſtations of God</hi> to our ſoules muſt be had in the uſe of ordinary gifts in ſearch and ſtudy of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3</label> Becauſe if God had ſtill continued his ſpeaking to his Saints by extraordinary wayes, and by perſons infallibly inſpired, ſuch as were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, he had taken a courſe to keep his people at a lower ſtature in beleeving then is now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to: Had there been advantage in continuing ſuch meanes, the perſonal preſence of Chriſt in the fleſh amongſt us, of all other had been the greateſt; but we ſee what our Saviour ſaith to that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>It is expedient for you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I go away;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that there was intended for the Church a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate, by his preſence with us in the Spirit, then what they had by his preſence in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe our faith had ſtood more in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and perſonall reſpects of the meſſengers, and leſſe in the evidence of the truth it ſelfe, and ſo leſſe in God; that which the Apoſtle endeavoured ſo much to prevent in his hearers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>I was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118924:84"/> with you</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in weakneſſe, and in feare, and in much trembling, and my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, and of power.</hi> That is, he ſought not to gain upon them ſo much by perſonall reſpects, but by the evidence of the truth it ſelfe, as he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>By the demonſtration of the truth commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to every mans conſcience.</hi> He gives the reaſon of his practice, v. 5. <hi>That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdome of men, but in the power of God:</hi> which is attained unto rather by this way of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, when by comparing places and things together, our faith is reſolved into, and faſtned upon the ſelfe-evidencing light which is in truth, then by taking all from Prophets or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>Had that been ſtill the way, as in the Primitive times it was, and the times before Chriſt, how apt we ſhould have been to take things upon truſt from an Apoſtle, and not to ſearch into the truth it ſelfe, is evident, if we conſider, Firſt, how naturall it is to us, our own corruption leading us unto it, to take up things on truſt from man, that ſo we may not have to doe with God in any truth, becauſe thereby the fleſh is crucified, which therefore ſtrives againſt it, and will cloſe with creatures to ſhift off him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if we conſider one great experiment which the world hath had in this particular, which is this: <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7. 1 Joh. 2. 18.</note> We know that in the Primitive times, even in the Apoſtles daies, Antichriſt had his riſe, and by degrees he gained upon the Church. In theſe our daies An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is falling, and looſing every day, and ſo as never to ariſe again. What is the reaſon, ſince their light was the ſame with ours, in ſome reſpects grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118924:85"/> Conſider where lieth his ſtrength, and that will point you to it. It lieth in an implicit faith, that people will believe as the Church believes; take that away, it is to Antichriſt as the removing of that <hi>pillar</hi> by <hi>Sampſon</hi> was unto the Philiſtims, when the houſe and the Philiſtims came down together. This now points us to conſider, if one reaſon why he then roſe, and is now falling, though the light whereby he falls is the ſame which then was in the world, be not becauſe then the truth was taken more upon truſt from the Apoſtles; whereas now the light we gain is by ſearch and ſtudy of the Scriptures, whereby believers are more eſtabliſhed and built upon the light of the truth it ſelfe; for what light we gain by induſtry &amp; ſtudy ſticks by us, is more digeſted, more powerfull and uſefull in the ſoule. Therefore how often is this urged by the Apoſtles to <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> and to <hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> And, <hi>If we</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preach another Goſpel, let him be accurſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe our underſtandings had not been ſo exerciſed and improved, which is a great part of Gods deſigne, in as much as the excellency of man lieth in his reaſon. It is true, the way of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is by the death of the old man, with all his excellencies whatſoever, ſo as reaſon it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a dead thing to us, as conſidered onely of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but though it dies, it doth not periſh, but growes up in the new creature to a glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and increaſe; <hi>That which thou ſoweſt</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>is not quickened except it die:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 36.</note> it dyeth therefore that it may be quickened in the new birth, wherein it is ſanctified by Chriſt, and afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the utmoſt in his children: For which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118924:85"/> purpoſe God findes himſelf engaged to bring matters unto ſuch a ſtate, as by labour in the uſe of reaſon ſanctified, a man may ſearch into the deep things of God, without ſuch extraordinary helps; and when ſhould that be expected if not in theſe laſt days, when <hi>God hath ſpoken to us by his Sonne,</hi> whereby he hath rendred himſelfe with greateſt advantage to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of his people? Now I ſay, had thoſe ways of ſpeaking by extraordinary revelations been continued, we had been apt to take things up with caſe from an Apoſtle without ſtudy or labour in the uſe of our underſtandings. The rather is this to be urged, becauſe God will be ſerved by our <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> as well as other faculties, therefore will omit no courſe that might be taken, whereby to neceſſitate and provoke us thereunto. Therefore had thoſe ways been ſtill in uſe, we had been hindred in our growth in faith and in the knowledge of God and of his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe therein alſo ſtands the growth &amp; ſtrength of Chriſtians, not onely that they happen upon the truth, which thoſe who are weak may do, but alſo that they be throughly poſſeſſed of it, and ſeaſoned with it, that it be well digeſted and made their own; ſo as they be able to manage and improve it for their comfort, and for a withſtanding of gainſayers; which is not ſo wel attained when truth is taken in without ſtudy from an Apoſtle or the like. What a man gains by ſtudy he is able to maſter, and that maſters him, and he keeps it better, and that keeps him. A man that takes a truth on truſt may keep it by him till he be withſtood, but when oppoſition comes, he is not able to reply, and muſt go for an anſwer unto him on whom his faith is pinned. There would have been
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:118924:86"/> at leaſt more of this in Chriſtians, had not thoſe ways been laid aſide, then now there is, though there is too much of it notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> You will ſay, that by what hath been ſaid, it ſeems that the Saints in theſe our dayes are in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate, or in a more noble way of knowledge, then they were in the Apoſtles times, whoſe practices are our patterns or examples, and in many caſes made the rule of our actions, which ſeemeth hard to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, that their practice being our pattern which we are to follow, is not becauſe they were in a more noble or better way of knowing the minde of God to edification, but becauſe thereby is hinted to us what was the word and mind of the Sonne of God, who is the <hi>Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as touching the practice of the Saints in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages; we having no more certain way in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to know what the Sonne taught, both by himſelfe and his Apoſtles, touching his worſhip and ſervice, then by what we finde was the common and received practice of the Churches in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in ſome reſpect we are in a more noble and a more edifying way of finding out the mind and will of God, then they were then, appears by this, becauſe that was the time of <hi>laying foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ours are the times of <hi>building upon foundations</hi> being layed, and of <hi>growing up to a more perfect man; Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. 13. Now though there be a ſtrength in the foundation that is not in the building, yet there is an eminency in the building above foundations.</p>
               <p>It appeares alſo, in that when knowledge ſhall moſt increaſe, which towards the end it ſhall, it ſhall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118924:86"/> increaſe that way; namely, by labour and ſtudy in ſearching of the Scriptures, not by extraordinary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or revelations. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>At the time of the end many ſhall run to and fro,</hi> that is, ſhall ſearch to and fro, <hi>and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> The ſame word is uſed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord do runne to and fro throughout the earth, to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong for them whoſe heart is perfect towards him, that is, he ſearches and ſeeks occaſions to ſhew his power for ſuch; it is meant of ſuch a going to and fro as men uſe in ſearching; ſuch as when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went about gathering the Manna, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 8. where the ſame word is alſo uſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I may adde that which was mentioned before concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that notwithſtanding in the Apoſtles dayes the ſame light did ſhine forth among the Saints, and in ſome reſpect greater, yet that then he had his riſe and increaſe, and in theſe our days is falling and declining to his utter ruin and extirpation; which ſhewes that the Saints of theſe times in ſome reſpect, even in point of knowledge and edification therein, have preheminence above thoſe who lived in the Apoſtles times.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, you ſhall runne a moſt deſperate hazard of deluſion, becauſe you are not in your way, and ſo have nothing to defend you from the ſubtilties of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright, Prov.</hi> 10. 29. And <hi>he hath given his Angels a charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways, Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. but out of your way you have no promiſe of protection; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, If it be in things within the compaſs of <hi>nature and reaſon, ſenſe and reaſon</hi> is your guide, &amp; look what their direction is, that is your way; and a ſufficient guard they are from his deluſions; therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 39. <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my ſelf; handle me &amp; ſee; for a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have:</hi> implying, that in matters of that nature, <hi>ſenſe and reaſon</hi> rightly uſed are a defence ſufficient, in a common way of providence, from deluſions of the Devil. Or if it be in matters above nature (as the things of the Spirit are) yet if you keep to the word of God, that is your way, and that will keep you, and be your protection; becauſe it is a <hi>creating word,</hi> ſo as although it ſpeaks of glorious things, above the line or ſphere of nature, yet is it able to make all good. But if it be in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things you deal without <hi>ſenſe and reaſon,</hi> or in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and ſupernatural things, without the Scripture, or in any other way of revelation then by the word of God, which he hath ſpoken by his ſonne, now are ye upon the Devils ground, and in his ſnare, and he ſhall lead you captive at his will; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26. <hi>Thoſe who oppoſe or acknowledge not the truth are in the ſnare of the Devil and taken captive by him at his will.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe he is a ſpirit,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118924:87"/> who can make powerfull impreſſions upon phanſie, and much reſembling thoſe of the ſpirit of God, and ſo in ſtead of a Conception by the Holy Ghoſt, you ſhall ere you are aware receive a ſtrong deluſion of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by this means will you be taken off from that where your advantage lies, embracing in ſtead thereof a phanſie or a ſhadow. Thus the Jewes, who <hi>followed after the Law of righteouſneſſe,</hi> their deſire in general was good: <hi>I bear them record</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>that they have a zeale of God, but they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> and ſo by means of that diverſion, were deluded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and their own corruption, and <hi>attained not the Law of righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 9. 31. Thus alſo the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples did not know, or not conſider, how their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was in <hi>Chriſt crucified;</hi> their hearts were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſet upon an earthly glory; for which cauſe how <hi>fooliſh and ſlow of heart were they to beleeve all that the Prophets had ſaid concerning Chriſt? Luk.</hi> 24. 25. So in this caſe, the advantage of the Saints lieth in their being <hi>led by the Spirit into all truth:</hi> and that <hi>not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſpeaking of himſelf, but by taking of the things of Chriſt, and ſhewing them unto us.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 16. 13, 14.</note> Now therefore, if you neglect the ſtudy of the Scriptures, ſeeking after and expecting revelations extraordinary by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you are beſides your work, and loſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſeaſon.

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:118924:88"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>you muſt give the more earneſt heed to the things which are ſpoken.</hi> This is the Uſe made of this point by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. having in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proved this Doctrine, that <hi>God hath ſpoken to us by his Sonne,</hi> and withall ſet forth his dignity above the Angels, that is his concluſion, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leaſt at any time we let them ſlip.</hi> This is the great impediment whereby the ſaving vertue of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is obſtructed, and it becomes ſo fruitleſſe in the ſoules of men, becauſe other things are heeded ſo ſo much, and that ſo little; Dogges and Horſes are regarded by us; but when <hi>God hath written to us the great things of his Law, they are accounted as a ſtrange thing.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hoſe. 8. 12</note> This is the cauſe why after ſo much meanes enjoyed, ſo little good is done; when after many <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers</hi> the Lord hath ſent his <hi>Sonne,</hi> in ſtead of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him the fruits of his Vineyard, the ſons of men <hi>conſpire to kill the Son that ſo the Vineyard may be theirs.</hi> Chriſt hath ſaid enough to overcome the hardeſt heart, he ſhews the plenty of his Fathers houſe, the priviledge and bleſſed ſtate of the ſonnes of God, the ſweetneſſe of a pardon, the glory of the life to come: but alas, it is not a careleſſe ſlothful or bare hearing that will doe the work. <hi>Hearken diligently unto me,</hi> (ſays God) ſo <hi>hear and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>you muſt continue in his word,</hi> and <hi>not be toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, as clouds

Such therefore as are ever wavering and flitting to and fro without eſtabliſhment, ſo far at leaſt as they are ſo unconſtant and unſetled, they are not taught by him, but by their own corrupt and ſinful ends, or they take up things on truſt from men, and ſo as the tide turnes they turn and float about, according to the ſtream and current of the times, or as they are biaſed from their own corruptions. Two things muſt be in this continuing in the word of Chriſt. Firſt, the underſtanding muſt be eſtabliſhed in the truth, and you in ſome meaſureable with your own eyes to ſee it, and to charge it home upon your ſouls as the truth of God.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The truth muſt make you free,</hi> Joh. 8. 32. <hi>Then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free: if ihe ſon makes you free, then are ye free indeed.</hi> Two things there are in this freedome.

It is not enough that you continue in the word, unleſſe it hath this powerfull ſaving work upon you, to change the heart, to ſanctifie it, and to ſubdue the ſoule to the power of the truth and grace of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you muſt labour to receive the Word not in <hi>the letter</hi> only, but <hi>the ſpirit</hi> alſo with the word. <hi>The Spirit is received,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>by the hearing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118924:89"/> of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 2. And <hi>beleeving ye were ſealed by the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. which being a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bleſſing upon, and effect of the <hi>Sons ſpeaking,</hi> (as we have heard) therefore that you may hear as thoſe who are ſpoken to by the Sonne, this alſo muſt be added.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the revelations to be expected, and which you are to labour for; and this is the onely way to be above external formes and outſides; not to lay formes aſide, for ſo you are beſides them, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them; but by a right uſe of them to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter higher things, for which they are deſigned. <hi>I through the law, am dead to the law,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19.</note> that is, by a right uſe of the Law he was dead to the Law: ſo by a right uſe of formes, (which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the preaching of the Word, or any other Ordinances, to be made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt in the uſe of them) in a right ſenſe underſtood, wee are above them.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt true, to reſt in any formes, even in the Letter of the Word it ſelfe, that is, in the meer noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or underſtanding of it, without the Spirit, is low and poor and beggarly; but by way of prevention or redreſſe hereof, to ſeek and wait for extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revelations, is out of one extreame into another, and in ſtriving to be above formes, to neglect and lay aſide the ordinances and wayes of God, which he hath ſanctified and ſet apart to be the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of a bleſſed enjoyment of himſelfe. Nor will this do the work pretended; this ſeeking after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelations, is as low and poor a matter as the other. Thoſe were uſefull onely in the time of the Churches infancie, or when foundations were in laying, as was ſhewed before; therefore whilſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118924:90"/> men ſeek that way to be above, they are below, even in the duſt. The fruit of every ordinance in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is an <hi>anointing with freſh oyle,</hi> (even a further par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Spirit of God) ſo the comfort of a Sabbath is expreſt in that Pſal. 92. 10. entitled <hi>A Pſalm or Song for the Sabbath day,</hi> and ſo the bleſſing of the houſe of God is ſet forth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 5, 6. As for inſtance, In prayer <hi>our heavenly father</hi> giveth the <hi>Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. And <hi>by one Spirit are we baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12 13. In the ſupper of the Lord, we have <hi>the communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi> namely, in partaking with our head in the ſame anointing with the holy Ghoſt: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16.</note> &amp; <hi>are all made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And ſo in all the reſt. The worke therefore to be done in this alſo of hearing the Word, is, that <hi>by the hearing of Faith we receive the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 2. and that upon our <hi>beleeving we are ſealed by the holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. that is, that there be,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A <hi>powerful impreſſion</hi> by the word upon the ſoule, from the ſpirits witneſs to it, ſetting of it home with life and vigour, begetting and confirming faith, changing the heart, ſubduing it unto the power of the truth of God, ſo making it unto the ſoul a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word, without which work it is but a dead letter to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Image of Chriſt,</hi> as it were, ſtamped upon the ſoule in that <hi>impreſſion;</hi> elſewhere called his being <hi>formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. in reference to which the word is called an immortal ſeed, that liveth &amp; abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever; by which we are <hi>begotten in the new birth;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> called alſo <hi>an ingraffed</hi> word, <note place="margin">James 1: 18, 21</note> becauſe it turneth us into its own nature, and makes us like to Jeſus Chriſt; which image conſiſteth in our likeneſſe to him in his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118924:90"/> 
                     <hi>death and reſurrection,</hi> Philip. 3. 10. in the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne, and a ſpiritual reſurrection unto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A <hi>witneſſe of the ſpirit</hi> to the ſoule of our intereſt in God upon this new birth, and giving us the <hi>earneſt of our inheritance,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1: 14.</note> in our enjoyments of him, in communion with all the perſons of the Trinity, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt. 1 Joh. 5, 6, 7, 8. Rom. 8. 16. 17.</p>

                  <p>A third uſe of the point may be a confutation of that opinion entertained by ſome, that there are not now in being any true Miniſters of Chriſt, who can as <hi>Ambaſſadours from Chriſt,</hi> in the name of God and in his authority ſpeak unto the people, becauſe there are none that can take upon them to preach by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſpirit. The reaſon alledged is becauſe thoſe who ſpeak ſo in the name of God, as his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, or as in his ſtead, muſt do it by a <hi>Word</hi> which is wholly, undoubtedly, and meerly true, that ſo they may be certainly known both to themſelves and others to be ſo commiſſioned from the Lord, and that both preachers and hearers may be infallibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that it is indeed the word of God which they preach. Thus ſay they, the firſt lawful preaching of the Goſpel was performed by word of mouth, and that ſuch as was <hi>ſyncere,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>Sound Doctrine,</hi> Titus 1. 9. Such as was <hi>received not as the word of men, but as it was indeed the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. And therefore ſince God hath nowhere commanded nor licenſed, that what was begun by ſuch a word of truth, ſhould afterwards be carried on by a word not wholly and meerly true, that thoſe who now take upon them to perform that office of a Miniſter in the worſhip of God, ſpeaking in the name of God, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118924:91"/> as his Ambaſſadours unto the people, in as much as they cannot pretend to ſuch infallibility, do act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commiſſion, and are guilty of will-worſhip, and are not to be reputed the miniſters of Chriſt, in as much as all Adminiſtrations in the Church are to be by his inſtitution and command.</p>
                  <p>Now from that which hath been ſaid in opening this point, we have a full and ſatisfying anſwer unto this: namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that however in laying the foundations of the Church of the New Teſtament, and in ſetting down the inſtitutions of the worſhip, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that God ſhould make uſe of perſons of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gifts, which accordingly was done in Chriſt and his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; yet that it was never intended that the work ſhould be carried on by ſuch, but that in building upon thoſe foundations, and in the Churches growing up even to <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature</hi> to which it is intended in this world, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13.</note> the work of God ſhould goe on and proſper in the hands of his ſervants by the uſe of ordinary gifts, in ſtudying the Scriptures, and in teaching and inſtructing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the knowledge of the Goſpel, and ſo as each teacher in the Church hath need to be taught, and is ſuppoſed to be ſubject unto errour, as hath been ſhewed from 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>pag.</hi> 145. which will yet be more clear from that place, if it be conſidered that thoſe duties there mentioned by the Apoſtle in that golden chaine, from verſ. 16. to 21. are linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch order, as they are depending one upon another in a Chriſtians practice, as if we ſhould read them thus; That ye may <hi>rejoyce evermore, pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing,</hi> for that end <hi>in every thing give thanks,</hi> for that end <hi>quench not the Spirit,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; as you
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118924:91"/> would not <hi>quench the Spirit, deſpiſe not propheſie,</hi> and for that end <hi>prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good;</hi> for he that proves them not, deſpiſeth his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doctrine as not worthy to be conſidered or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Now this connection betweene theſe duties being the Apoſtles ſcope, it appears that the Spirit is quenched by deſpiſing that propheſying wherein there may be ſome errours and miſtakes. Therefore however the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts who were to write the Scripture, had an infallible gift, yet ordinary Elders of Churches even in the Apoſtles time had it not, but were ſubject to miſtakes as we ſee in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the ſeven Churches, Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. And of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>even from amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſciples after them,</hi> Acts 20. 30.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſee alſo, that the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of the New Teſtament beſpeaketh as much, that the Church ſhould be built up by the uſe of ſuch gifts onely, and that extraordinary gifts ſhould ceaſe, as hath been ſhewed in the third Reaſon of the point. God had otherwiſe in part loſt his end in ſpeaking to us by his Sonne, of which his ſpeaking one end was, that he might bring down the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf ſo farre to our capacity, as that in the uſe of ordinary gifts by ſearch and ſtudy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we might underſtand the great and deep things of God, without the help of gifts infallible and extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the nature of the office of a Paſtour and Teacher in the Church ſpeaketh no leſſe, in as much as they are called <hi>Elders and leaders,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>not as Lords over Gods heritage, but as examples to the flock,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> to go before the people in the ſame work
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118924:92"/> wherein the whole Church is engaged, namely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things in the <hi>ſearch and ſtudy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> therefore ſuppoſed to be endued but with the ſame gifts for kind with the reſt of their brethren, the difference betweene them and others, in reſpect of gifts, being onely in degree and eminency, not in kind, as hath been ſhewed; choſen therefore they are by the Church from amongſt themſelves, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to certain rules ſet down in Scripture, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> 1. which might not be in caſe they ſhould be perſons extraordinarily inſpired, and could ſpeak by an infallible Spirit, and known ſuch to be, for ſuch can be choſen onely by God himſelf, either immediately from Heaven, or by a Prophet or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; in which caſe the Lord alſo giveth <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to ſuch choice <hi>by the gift of miracles,</hi> Heb. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any diſadvantage to the Church to be taught by ſuch who are themſelves ſubject unto er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſince we are not to take any thing meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt from our Teachers, but are commanded to <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> and to <hi>prove all things:</hi> And <hi>if we</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>or an Angel from Heaven preach another Goſpel unto you, let him be accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1. 8. Nay I may adde, that ſince our work and duty is to ſearch the Scriptures, it is for our advantage that our Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders who go before us therein are perſons of the ſame gifts, and ſubject to the ſame infirmities with our ſelves, becauſe hereby that wherein they excell will be a provocation and encouragement to us to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in the ſame ſtudy and labour. And that wherein they are defective layeth a neceſſity on us to ſearch and ſtudy ſo much the more, leſt we be miſled. And had the Lord continued perſons of ſuch infallible gifts, it had been a means to take us off
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118924:92"/> from that laborious and diligent ſearch and ſtudy of the Scriptures, which now we are neceſſitated to, as was ſhewed at large in opening the point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Queſt.</label> If the Queſtion be, how ſuch perſons then can ſpeak unto the people as <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> from God, and <hi>in his name,</hi> ſo as the people may receive it in his <hi>authority,</hi> and may be aſſured that what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is indeed the <hi>word and truth of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> That it is true indeed, if when we receive the truth as ſpoken to us <hi>in the name of God,</hi> it were to be ſuppoſed that we receive it onely upon truſt from thoſe who are our Teachers, it muſt then be granted that none can ſpeak to us <hi>in the name of God</hi> but only ſuch as have an <hi>infallible gift,</hi> and of whom we can be certain of their <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> therein; but that is not our work to build our faith onely upon the credit of our Teachers, (although that is not to be denied its due reſpect) but, what ever certainty we have of their <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> our faith hath a further ground to fix upon; namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, upon the ſelfe-evidencing property which is <hi>in light and truth;</hi> for which cauſe it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelf ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge what I ſay:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>If we or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you then that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> Therefore alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. he ſaith that he and his fellow-labourers did not take any other courſe, or uſe any other meanes to gain upon their hearers, but by <hi>manifeſtation of the truth, commending themſelves to every mans conſcience.</hi> Such things revealed concerning God, and Chriſt, and man, ſo put together in one body of light, each part thereof bearing witneſs to, illuſtrating and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118924:93"/> the other, all agreeing in ſuch full conſent and harmony of truth, ſo far beyond the wit of any creature to have invented, is diſcerned and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by true beleevers to be the truth of God, and in ſome ſort not unlike, as light is known to be light by him that ſees it; therefore I ſay, that is one thing upon which our faith in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth of God depends, beyond the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our teachers how great ſoever it be. And yet this is not enough, becauſe ſuch is mans impotency and corruption, being left unto himſelf, as his light is his darkneſſe, ſo as by how much the ſtronger his reaſon is, ſo much the more he is infatuated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded; <hi>ſeeing he ſeeth not, and hearing he doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nor yet perceive;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth: 6. 23: &amp; 13. 13.</note> therefore I muſt adde, That our faith dependeth,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon the inward teſtimony and work of Gods ſpirit, <hi>opening the heart</hi> and inabling us to ſee this light, and to beleeve the truth: And without this work of the ſpirit, whatever may be ſaid in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a full beleefe thereof as the truth of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you all things</hi> Joh. 16. 13. <hi>He ſhall lead you into all truth;</hi> 1 John 2. 20. 27. <hi>Ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 21. 22. <hi>He which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God, who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of his ſpirit in our hearts.</hi> Therfore when the Lord Chriſt himſelf preached, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. the Jewes deſpiſing him and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> our Saviour ſaith the reaſon was becauſe <hi>they were not taught of God,</hi> verſ. 43.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſ.</label> I anſwer. Firſt, not by extraordinary or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelations, as was ſhewed from <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>p.</hi> 137. <hi>The ſpirit ſhal not ſpeak of himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. The ſpirit wil not come to any man and ſay in ſo many words, this is truth, or this is Scripture, or this the word of God. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſpirit doth it by ſanctifying us through the truth, <hi>John</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> So John 7. 17. <hi>If any man will do the will of him that ſent me,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>he ſhall know of my doctrine whether it be of God or not:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. The Apoſtle to prove the word to be the <hi>immortal ſeed of God,</hi> ſaith, <hi>it liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> thereby intimating, that it <hi>abideth</hi> not where it <hi>liveth</hi> not; therefore by its being made a <hi>ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word</hi> it becomes an <hi>abiding word</hi> in that ſoule. A ſanctifying word is when together with it we receive the ſpirit, which is a fountain of life in every believer.</p>
                  <p>Three things there are in this his ſanctifying us through the truth wherby we are brought to believe it to be the truth of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in this <hi>ſanctification</hi> a man is by the ſpirit wrought to give up himſelfe to the <hi>power of this truth of God as his,</hi> and that in every facultie; for that is the nature of ſanctification, it is a giving up or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of a thing to God; <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1. 2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> and in voluntary agents it is a giving up of themſelves to God, elſe the will is not given up to him, and ſo the man is not ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore in the ſanctification of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it is made active in its own illumination, and gives up it ſelfe to the power of the <hi>word of truth,</hi> and to God therein; hence it is that whilſt the ſpirit of God <hi>ſanctifies us through the truth,</hi> it begets in us a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe that it is the truth of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this <hi>ſanctification,</hi> ſo far as it prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118924:94"/> (for it is but <hi>in part</hi> in this world) we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the corrupt biaſings of the heart, which are the cauſe of all our darkneſs and unbeliefe, of all thoſe ſhifts &amp; evaſions wherby we are kept from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his authority in his word; <hi>men of corrupt minds</hi> they are <hi>who are reprobate concerning the faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the work of <hi>ſanctification</hi> the ſoule findes the infinite power of God in this <hi>truth,</hi> in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſinne, in a new birth to righteouſneſſe, and in filling of the ſoule with comfort, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is a work ſecretly carried on in the ſoule, and ſo many times the power of the <hi>ſanctifying word</hi> not much taken notice of in actual thoughts, yet the ſoule wherein it is accordingly doth ſecretly owne and acknowledge this power of the word, and God himſelfe therein, yea even when actual thoughts from the corruption of the unregenerate part are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning againſt it, and would not ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee upon what further ground our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the truth as the truth and word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, beſides the credit of the perſons by whom we are inſtructed and taught therein; Who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may be acknowledged as <hi>Ambaſſadours from Chriſt,</hi> who ſpeak to us <hi>in the name of God</hi> and in his <hi>Authority,</hi> upon a twofold account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from <hi>the nature of their work,</hi> which is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the truth of God; in which although much of the truth ſlips beſides our faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe of the weakneſſe both of Teacher and Hearer, and it may be but very little of it is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us, yet ſomething is done in that behalfe, ſo as we can ſay of this and that particular truth which we have learned by their meanes, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word of God; and how ſmall ſoever that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118924:94"/> be, yet it cometh upon our ſoules from our Teachers <hi>in the name of God</hi> and <hi>in his authority,</hi> becauſe, as it will be granted that when we receive the truth of God in his authority, it is not therefore to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that we are preſently poſſeſſed of all the truth of God at once, nor of all that truth which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us, ſhould it be by perſons of infallible gifts, becauſe we receive no more then what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; ſo it is as true, that how ſmall ſoever that part of the truth of the Goſpell be that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as truth, we cannot but receive it <hi>in his name and authority,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>the God of truth,</hi> and the things revealed in it are ſuch as none elſe could reveale but he; therefore called his truth, John 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> And indeed that onely doe we receive <hi>in his name and authority,</hi> which we receive <hi>as truth,</hi> were it by perſons of infallible gifts; therefore I ſay, ſo far as they are able to faſten any truth upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, they are truly ſaid even from <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their work</hi> to ſpeake to us <hi>in the name of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, from <hi>the nature of their office,</hi> which is ſuch as they are therein conſecrated, and appointed by a creating word of inſtitution, to be in this thing in ſtead of Chriſt himſelf unto the Church; ſo as he ſaith to them, <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me,</hi> Luke 10. 16. and 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>We</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of himſelf and others, as thoſe to whom God had <hi>committed the miniſtery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> verſ. 19. Now that miniſterie was committed not onely to Apoſtles and Evangeliſts.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118924:95"/> 
                     <hi>He gave alſo Paſtours and Teachers, for the work of the miniſterie,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. 12. So Heb. 13. 7. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, by vertue of his word of inſtitution they are in this capacity, not by vertue of any infallibility or freedome from errour in their teaching. The <hi>miniſtery</hi> is that Ordinance of God whereby the truth of God is by degrees to be diſcovered, and whereby that which is diſcovered to be his truth, ſhould come upon the ſoule in the ſame Authority and Power, as if God himſelfe did ſpeak it to us. God could as eaſily have ſpoken to us himſelfe from time to time, but he chuſeth rather and finds it neceſſary to deal with us according to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>that his terrour may not make us afraid,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job, (Job</hi> 33. 7.) and to bring downe the knowledge of himſelfe to ſuch wayes and meanes agreeable to our condition, as that we may receive it <hi>in earthen veſſels,</hi> and yet be aſſured that it is the <hi>word and truth of God,</hi> and ſo as that in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the miniſtery we have that which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent unto his ſpeaking to us himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>This is the manner of Gods dealing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in beſtowing himſelf upon us, that what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have immediately by himſelfe, by vertue of his ordinances we ſhould have in equivalency or in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect made good unto us: which is one reaſon why the Scripture calleth a falſe Ordinance an Idol, or a falſe god; namely, becauſe that is the nature and uſe of the ordinances of the worſhip of God, to be to us as in his ſtead, or to be equivalently or in effect as Chriſt himſelfe unto our ſoules. Thus in the <hi>ſupper of the Lord,</hi> we have <hi>his body and blood,</hi> though not his body and blood in nature, or by tranſubſtantiation, yet becauſe that ſupper is his ordinance, wherein we do
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118924:95"/> enjoy the <hi>communion of his body and blood,</hi> the bread and wine in that uſe and adminiſtration is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, or in effect, <hi>the body and blood of Chriſt</hi> unto us. So the <hi>Church</hi> wherein we worſhip God, is called the <hi>body and houſe of Christ,</hi> though as in it ſelfe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red conſiſting but of a few, and of them it may be a great part Hypocrites, it cannot properly or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be ſo called; yet that being his ordinance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we enjoy communion with him as <hi>members of his myſtical body,</hi> and as the <hi>temples of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and wherein we do the work and enjoy the comfort which belongeth unto us as ſuch, therfore in equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and in the way of an ordinance, that Church is to us the body and houſe of Chriſt. 1 Cor. 12. 27. <hi>The Church of Corinth is</hi> called <hi>his body,</hi> and <hi>the Church of Epheſus</hi> is called <hi>his houſe, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 22. Therefore in that ſociety of profeſſours wherein we worſhip God, by vertue of his inſtitution, we have as much as if <hi>the whole family of heaven and earth</hi> were met and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they; and in caſe a man be juſtly and orderly caſt out by the Church, the ſentence is as dreadful and falleth as heavy upon his ſoule, as if Chriſt and all his Saints and onely they had paſſed the ſentence: ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Whatſoever ye bind on earth ſhal be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> And as ſuch a ſociety of Chriſtians is <hi>his body,</hi> ſo they <hi>meet together in his name,</hi> (for thoſe who are his body are inveſted with his power and authority) although ſome of them ſo meeting, as to their perſonall ſtate and condition, are not <hi>his members.</hi> So alſo is it in the miniſters of the Church, though in themſelves they are ſubject unto errour and infirmitie as others are, yet by vertue of a like inſtitution of Chriſt, in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118924:96"/> the execution of their function, look what truth they are able, by ſuch gifts as they have, to faſten upon our underſtandings, it cometh to us <hi>in the name of God,</hi> and in the ſame <hi>authority</hi> as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe had ſpoken it unto us.</p>
                  <p>For a further clearing whereof, let it be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that becauſe the <hi>miniſtration of the New Teſtament is a miniſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. therefore not onely the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> but alſo <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> who alſo are given by Chriſt <hi>for the work of that miniſtery,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note> (as hath been ſhewed) are <hi>miniſters not of the letter but of the ſpirit:</hi> For which cauſe alſo the Apoſtle ſaith of all the Saints in the <hi>Churches of Galatia,</hi> concerning whom we cannot ſuppoſe that they were all converted by Apoſtles, that they had <hi>received the ſpirit by the hearing of faith,</hi> Galat. 3. 2. Which being ſo, it may be truly ſaid of us, that even in their miniſtery we are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt, and that in their teaching, ſo far as we are fruitfull hearers, we are taught by God himſelf, who therefore may very well be ſaid to receive the word from ſuch miniſters, as ſpoken unto us by them in his name, and as in his ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Now by that which hath been ſaid I ſuppoſe it doth appear, that albeit there are none that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend infallibility, yet that they may be true <hi>miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> who may ſpeak unto the people <hi>in his name</hi> and as <hi>his Ambaſſadours.</hi>

                  <p>Learn from hence alſo how much they are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the other ſide, who becauſe of the Spirits teaching promiſed to beleevers cry downe <hi>humane learning</hi> as unneceſſary in a Miniſter of the Goſpel. The ſpirit of God we ſee makes uſe of ordinary gifts; Yea thoſe who are not beleevers may be meanes to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118924:96"/> build up thoſe who are. As ſome of thoſe who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the flood did help to build the Ark, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church was ſaved. Many ſuch will at the laſt day ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils? Matth.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
                  <p>Were we to expect ſuch wayes of Revelation, whereby Apoſtles were enabled in their work, yet humane learning would not be uſeleſſe to us. The ſpirit of God knows how to make uſe of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages it findes in nature, whereof this is one. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was <hi>brought up at the feet of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel, ſo he makes uſe of his learning in his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Much more now thoſe extraordinary wayes are ceaſed, is it uſefull in the Church of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the underſtandings of men are exerciſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and they made more able to ſearch into, to underſtand the Scriptures, to inſtruct others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The ſpirit of God hath made great uſe thereof in overthrowing and confounding Antichriſt: and as the Church is built up by uſe of ordinary gifts, ſo will he uſe it ſtil to carry on his work to more perfection.</p>
                  <p>As by the Sonnes ſpeaking God hath brought down the knowledge of himſelfe to our capacity, and that becauſe in Chriſt he makes himſelfe known to us in all the properties and affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, ſo accordingly the ſpirit of Chriſt worketh in us after the manner of man, even as the ſpirit of a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 47. Therefore though he worketh <hi>powerfully,</hi> yet he worketh <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and carries on his work ſo as to take us in, and to make us active in what is done. So our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſet out the manner of his working, <hi>John.</hi> 16. 13. as hath been ſhewed; <hi>He ſhall guide or leade you into all truth.</hi> He taketh time alſo and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by degrees, he worketh alſo by meanes, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118924:97"/> maketh uſe of mans reaſon, yea of every faculty in man, in carrying on his worke: and as by humane learning reaſon is improved, and taketh in more light, ſo alſo he works by that.</p>
                  <p>It is true that mans reaſon and the improvements of it by any learning whatſoever, without the ſpirits ſanctifying work, is but ſuch a <hi>light as is our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 23.</note> in which caſe, by how much the more a man excells therein, ſo much the more is he inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and intangled by his owne deceitfull heart; but being ſanctified, they are a great advantage in the ſpirits work, both in us and by us. Learning may be abuſed, and the beſt things corrupted are the worſt; but let not the abuſe of any thing beſpeak in us a caſting off, or a neglecting of its neceſſary uſe: ſo ſhould we debarre our ſelves the comfort of the choyceſt bleſſings in this World.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are to be a Chriſtians chiefeſt ſtudy; <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7. Pſal. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple; Bleſſed is the man that maketh it his delight and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> that hee may <hi>know Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> that he may be <hi>taught by him as the truth is in Jeſus, unto a full aſſurance of underſtanding of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt, in whom are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdome and Knowledge,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Col. 2. 2, 3. In compariſon to and without which all other learning is little worth. And yet becauſe this ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome ſo excells, it puts a value alſo upon the other, as being uſefull and ſubſervient thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and ſo as thoſe who are the true and knowing friends to this Scripture-learning cannot with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be enemies to that. Let all profeſſours of the true Religion and lovers of the truth be friends and cheriſhers thereof.</p>
